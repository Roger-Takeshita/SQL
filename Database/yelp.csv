ltk2xcvDFvuljYIpMnRqAA|2013-03-16|nMJPDub9kO4XhgRGiOfvcg|4|"Part of the Grayhawk Golf Club, this restaurant is one of my favorites based on the view and atmosphere alone.  It's a beautiful setting!  In multiple visits, the food generally does not disappoint, though I have seen some inconsistency which is the main reason I cannot give 5-stars.  For example, for my last visit there I had a thick pork chop that was very nicely seasoned and cooked (great!), but the side of mashed potatoes in a bowl was just dead cold.  I had to send it back, which the server handled nicely and I ended up with a nice hot serving to finish the meal.  The one ""can't miss"" item you have to order here is the Navajo Corn Chowder - it is really good!"|review|amyk3SFr79PwUOmE0o3ZFg|1|1|1
UL3OMN_c-NXHlyb97pDifA|2012-02-27|zhBLYy3c6MXyKyBZcR-hNg|4|While visiting Fashion Square Mall, my friend suggested we splurge and have a nice dinner. After looking at the menu, we decided to try it.  I enjoyed the Mac + Cheese- which was a large portion of  chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta & truffle oil. It was truly delicious and I enjoyed every bite of it. I paid extra for a ceasar salad that was nothing special, but still good.  My friend enjoyed the  Rib Eye (12oz) with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans & shallot butter. She stated it was the best steak that she had ever had. She also paid extra for a salad, and felt the same about her salad, but she also asked for extra ranch dressing, which never arrived.  My friend  also enjoyed a bikini martini that I had a taste of. It was just lovely but due to the prices of the drinks, opted to not have one.  The prices were kind of high to us, and our server didnt really give us warm fuzzy feelings, and at times we felt sort of rushed to complete our meal.  I think perhaps as a special occasion I would go again, perhaps not.  But it was definitely worth a try and the menu is diverse enough to have something cheaper.|review|dW7dXceuBcQ2UgNbEmAiZQ|0|0|0
KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ|2009-08-21|2lknhGeyXP1AegvMj0b9rg|5|I am so depressed! I live in the town of Cave Creek and have held Bryan's as my little secret, eating there 2 times a week for the past few months.  Now, the Arizona Republic comes out with a rave review and the place is packed.  Good news - the food is still made to order, hot (temperature) and lovely.  I have grown especially fond of the vegetarian version of a BBQ sandwich.  Even though I eat meat - I have died and gone to heaven every time I have one of Bryan's BBQ'd spaghetti squash sandwiches. Try one and you will see what I mean.  His sauces, especially the spicy one, are devine and the sides are tasty.  I always go with the fries but I love the potato salad too.  I newer addition of the Big Pig is also great if my husband is with me. Imagine a BBQ version of nachos - trading the chips with Byran's delicious fries and then loading the plate with his BBQ meat!  The place is ultra clean - thanks to all of his dedicated employees and you will find Bryan himself either behind the counter cooking or walking the floor making sure all of the diners are happy.    Only two complaints- Bryan's is closed sunday and the tv in the place is set to old movies.  If I could watch the Cardinal's play and eat a sandwich - that would be true bliss.|review|zFhCkeNQcIeyGTwX_sWP4Q|0|0|1

The food is generally good the only thing negative I have to say is sometimes the tofu can come out soggy but most of the time it is crisp and delicious. My favorite dish is the sesame chicken with fried rice. The staff here is always friendly and they have freestyle coca cola machines at this location! Would recommend for anyone looking for fast, fresh, and tasty Asian food.|review|HVqnEnkir1iGG0185VzYRA|0|0|0

bF7KQ6AQK5rBS7aOFKtlWg|2009-01-29|4149su18rB2FgXJaM8f-hw|4|i go to Dilly's whenever i have the urge to slip into a carb coma because the portions are HUGE. we're talking one sandwich cut in half looks more like two full sandwiches.  i always build my own to load up on the veggies (gotta pretend like i'm being healthy). the best thing is, you could request everything but the kitchen sink in your sandwich and the price never changes. in fact, you could probably request they throw in the kitchen sink, and the price would remain the same. it seems to be one of the only places that doesn't charge a premium for avocado.  for people who like punch cards, Dilly's has one. as far as atmosphere, don't expect any. it gets crowded here during lunch and the service is not always friendly but always fast. it's a great place to go if you feel like wolfing down a gigantic sandwich before passing out at your desk.|review|9y7Ni5EInmU20ySEs8ymyw|1|1|1
3g2ofV7mhEoPyfF7vFMObA|2007-07-19|qb0xQN9aMJIg-Ftu3bky-Q|2|Perhaps it really is all about a name.  When Maloney's changed to Mulligan's a bit ago, something happened over there on Stetson that simply cannot be explained.  Its the same damn bar, the same layout, the same movie clips, the same horribly small bathrooms.  And how, HOW is there an effing BATHROOM attendant in the men's bathroom??  The room is about the size of a closet for starters, and there isnt one in the ladies room.  Oh wait, maybe there is...  Regardless, the bathroom situation is miserable, which yes, has always been the case but there are a few changes that came with the name change of the bar.  I really liked Maloney's.  It was a total frat-house bar, with a 3-1 guy girl ratio (just the way I like it) with a serious amount of beer spilling and car bomb shooting.  If you were friends with a bartender (or just happened to recognize her from last night at Kona) you could get $100 worth of drink for $7.  That kind of deal makes anyone look past the ugly guy grinding on your leg over by the dance floor.  Music was always good, old school hip hop and popular more recent stuff.  Maloney's may have been packed but the crowd was generally good looking, recent college grads, doing what they do best.  Get really really hammered.    However I was there last weekend and something was seriously wrong.  The bar didnt get even remotely busy until later, which would have been fine but the talent there left something to be desired.  The bathroom still sucks and the music isnt as good.  I've heard their happy hour is two-for-one so whenever that is might be a better time to go than after 11pm.  I doubt I'll find myself there again at any hour.  Bummer...|review|E0WWNXVze_sfDCbM0oMYvw|3|1|2

LQuxnV4lsdztZuaWwB4c7Q|2011-12-22|TH_6hM0p1c85R1MD16Zsig|5|After comparing prices throughout the valley, we decided to go with Pacific Auto Glass. Although i was hesitant after reading the previous reviews I decided to stick with them.   The work was done in 45 minutes and I inspected my vehicle to make sure there weren't any damages I wasn't aware of. Although the owner said it was set and ready for me to drive around, I decided to wait a couple of hours (just to play it safe). The back of the receipt states that windows should be cracked opened for at least 24hrs after the installation to let it seal correctly and that the car shouldn't be washed or go through a car wash for at least 48hrs. And yes, I followed to rules to the T (didn't wanna risk ruining anything).  I followed these rules and so far am very pleased with their work! Its been a couple of weeks now since installing the new windshield and there haven't been any leaks of any kind (its rained a couple times and I've taken it to the car wash since then. No leaks!). The owner was on time, very kind and courteous, and knew what he was doing. For the price and for how well and quickly they worked, I would definitely recommend this business to others.|review|weVZEWMyGhtbDdMGfrzWDQ|0|0|0

My husband had the croque monsieur and I had the duck rillete both of which were really good and well priced but when we looked at all 3 of their menus I couldn't find anything that shouted wow I really want to go back and try this.   The staff were great, the food and atmosphere were good but I think I was expecting a more tapino-esque menu.  I know the owner/chef is very talented and  is starting over in this new location, I hope he does well.  The restaurant is small so I would recommend reservations.|review|HrMwMgstAwchQHVpj8ZmWg|0|0|0

They knew most of my group by name as well as their usual orders. They were helpful and accommodating and had amazing breakfast sandwiches.

yJr24Yy1K6bt2G9fX3_zPA|2010-09-19|OhF8U93kV18MBrtoRJeamw|4|I visited today with a friend & we were both very pleased with our dinner. We shared an appetizer of Calypso Chips which are fried plantain chips with black bean dip. I honestly wanted to lick the dip bowl, lol. I saved some room for the Pollo Cubano, which seemed like it would be a simple dish. Chicken, beans & rice. It was simply delicious. The chicken was moist & tasted of citrus & the beans & rice had a tang to them (not hot or spicy, just tasty). My friend had the ox tail, something I'd never had nor had I ever really wanted, lol, but I tasted it & it was very yummy. For desert we shared a small coconut flan with citrus sauce. It was good but very rich & filling. I washed it all down with a glass of the Veniterra - pinot grigio - Argentina wine.  The entire meal was great, the staff were very friendly & helpful. The location is simple, but I went there for the food, not cushy seats & I did love the live guitar music. It was a little pricier than I'd expected, but the servings are big. Next time I'll go for lunch!|review|BV8c4QZEzvPWA00ZqJp-jQ|0|1|1

We dined on the patio, which was quite plesent. Coffee extradionaire along with tasty iced tea. (unlimited refills) nice. I will for sure be back and bring in new friends to this hidden GEM.

My two personal favorite sandwiches are Capastrami (which is pastrami Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and cole slaw). Then the Bobbie which is ( Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo). Both are incredibly good i always have a hard time deciding between the two when i go. The service has always been good, and they make their sandwiches very quickly. They do a great job. The restaurant  is always clean and same with their bathrooms. I love this place! The only thing i wish changed was their prices. They are a little pricy for what you get but their food does outweigh their price, at least for me.|review|sR_mlVzYpvpunzwjRGJknQ|0|0|0

Warm Jumbo Bacon Salad - It's listed under Starter on the menu and that's how we ordered it.  It came out after all the burgers and fries.  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked.  It wasn't edible.  Chocolate Bread Pudding -  It was cold in the center.  We thought they had a great concept for a restaurant and we love burgers, so we were excited to eat there.

Here's what I like about the Garage:  -great vibe -friendly and competent servers (who also frequent some local bars in the area, so be nice b/c you'll run into them again!) -caprese salad -sweet potato fries -wide selection of awesome beers on tap - bet you haven't heard of several of them! - nice patio - nice TVs for the sports fans (though none on the patio) -hard cider on tap -tile on the ladies room is very pretty  =)  (yes, I did just write that! haha) -cute servers (both men and women), there are a fair amount of servers in this area who still have mullets and sport 80s do's so this is a nice change of pace!   This area of Central Phoenix pretty much has only dive bars or true restaurant/dining options. but the Garage offers the perfect medium in between.  You could go there for food or you could go there just for drinks.   Definitely recommend checking it out if you are in the area!|review|M6Wi9pKDx-W6rGgmf9GVMw|1|0|2

What a treat!  It turned out to be a really positive experience, and I had a good time.  My friend and I were seated right away and we decided to sit inside instead of on the patio. Neither of us had been here before, but since it seems to be a popular joint, and we had an idea of what to expect.  The place is an old house turned restaurant, and its really well decorated.  Nothing over done, but done just right.  Our server was real a real cute guy, and he told us all about the menu.  If you want to get one pizza and do half and half, you can do that.  They also have a great wine and alcohol menu as well, and I wish I would have ordered something to go with my pizza.  I went with the dovita pizza, which came with cheese and salame.  Tasty!

We had the Au Gratin potatoes, and while they were drenched in cheese, they still accompanied the steak very well. Wine selection is decent, though overpriced.

I got a pair of leather riding boots that fit me perfectly - I have large ""runners"" calves. My last riding boots looked cool - but were fake leather! Yuck!  The amazing boots were only 59.00 - this is unheard of for a pair of top of the line, well made leather riding boots! So I am one happy girl!  I also picked up a helmet - that was also on sale!  The sales woman was so nice, professional (knew her stuff) and guided me to exactly what I needed!  Loved this store - was broken hearted when the sales woman told me most people come in and try there stuff on - only to leave their store to find it on the internet cheaper!  Yuck!  People, lets support our local business's - this isn't a Nordstrom - I am pretty sure this is a family owned business!  Thank you Cindy and happy riding!  I will say the only negative thing is there location - it is a bit hard too see from the street - I wish for them (they had a more visable location).  Screw the internet - I like to try my stuff on and meet the nice, helpful people along the way! :)"|review|fQ65oVUPQ3RXhm6qtjUTSg|0|0|0

Conveniently located about 10 minutes from both the Phoenix airport and Mill Ave, this resort is off set from the chaos and noise of the down town Tempe while leaving everything accessible. I've stayed here for business twice now and both times have been a great experience. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and not the generic Marriott layout. The pool and hot tubs are laid in the red rock hillside with rivers and waterfalls, and there is a Central bar, Thirsty Cactus Pool Bar and grill, overlooking it all. The on-site restaurant, Top of the Rock, is a good meal from what I remember (didn't eat there on my recent stay), and the Market Cafe serves an variety of options for breakfast/brunch. If I'm in Tempe again, The Buttes is where I'm staying.|review|9mf3KnoyEtWPEGUI2Refpg|1|1|3

Firstly, I don't eat meat very often (sorta Vegetarian) so maybe people have had some poor dishes based on that. Secondly, I haven't stepped foot into the restaurant once (in my experience strip mall Chinese places aren't always the nicest looking on the inside)...  Those two things aside, I get take out from them often. The quality is good, they're super prompt, and the food is always hot.  So for what it is, it's convenient and decent.   I like that they'll sub anything --- If you want make it a Tofu dish, or Shrimp.  I usually get the Tom Yam Soup with Shrimp - Very good Orange Shrimp (I just ask them to make it) - Good Shrimp with Broccoli - Good.  I don't know about anything else...because it might be risky!  FYI - When ordering some of you complain about an accent on the phone. Use your brain, if you say ""Number 12 please..."" and she replies in a thick accent  ""wahtah ehg drahp"" She's probably relaying your order ""wonton egg drop"". Use your head. It's not complicated...and you're just being tactless."|review|oKzkyfGalJC3-BOeLLCcIw|0|1|5

We've been here for a few work dinners since we moved in, and everything is so good! The service is always great, and I'm never disappointed with what I get. My favorite appetizer is the kettle of green chile pork, which I could probably just finish off by myself. I've tried the roasted chicken and buttermilk-fried chicken on two occasions, and both are great. One is obviously better for you, but the fried chicken is a guilty pleasure I have no shame in ordering. They also have a great happy hour which is great to enjoy on the patio, but it fills up quickly, as they open at 4pm. I can't wait to get back here soon!|review|6OWHDbEq23f24Vki_veHBA|0|0|3

What a perfect place to host a small party!  As you are driving to the Tuck Shop you feel as if you are going to get lost.  However, we found it easily though based upon mapquest directions.    The atmosphere is interesting and unique.  My wife loved the decor, and it felt very comfortable.  I found it funny that a few people were confused by the sliding restroom doors and thought it was appropriate to use the bathroom in full view of anyone happening down the hallway!    I still remember the taste from a few standout dishes that night....mmmmm.....filet mignon and shrimp dish.  I'm not sure if we had a special menu for our group, or if the menu changes frequently, but I didn't see some of the items we ate when I browsed the menu on their website.    I have to go back again soon!|review|WHi6um_c1RaFecYZ-TlRfQ|1|1|0

gqLWBFxOKag8dXwVxEvTrg|2013-01-26|ZcXoS4Y4DDWqiFPhcBpd2Q|4|Setting:  I took my wife out on a Friday night date looking for great sushi and delicious appetizers.  Ambiance:  You are welcomed with a strong and friendly greeting by the waiters and sushi chefs.  We were quickly seated in a table for 2.  The sushi bar has a flatscreen tv that looks excellent if the place was packed or to enjoy a bite with friends.  The waitresses seemed to know plenty of repeat customers and were extremely friendly.  Food/Menu:  They have their special rolls of the day, special appetizers, and plenty of nigiri.  We ordered the ginger calamari that was sauteed, lobster miso soup, and 2 orders of the half shells of oysters for appetizers.  We then checked off a rainbow roll and california roll topped off with spicy tuna.  Ginger Calamari - flavorful with some vegetables, cooked just right, not too chewy.  Lobster Miso Soup - somewhat disappointed, 2 lobster tails filled with only little vegetables, and little flavor.  Oysters - the citrus sauce added a great flavor, decent sized oysters, but definitely had better fresh taste living in California.  Sushi - definitely agree with the majority of yelp reviewers with the hefty size of sushi, presentation well detailed, lots of good color and taste, better than average sushi.  Service:  Our waitress did a good job filling us up with water and switching out food from our table (the table for 2 was very small, and difficult to fit all the food we had).  No complaints from her.  Overall:  Besides the lobster miso soup, everything was delicious and we will definitely be back again for sushi!  Atmosphere is very casual and excellent for a date night.  The service is very welcoming and we enjoyed our night.  We will see you again Sakana!|review|_aMz2TsaWs7yCPY2P5Ti8w|0|0|0

Long story short, I got the steak and eggs breakfast a 12 oz steak, two eggs, hashbrowns, and pancakes. For twelve bucks.

(I typically get green curry and pad see ew.)  Today I went in for an early dinner around 5pm. There was literally one other couple in the entire restaurant and they already had their meals. We sat ourselves and were greeted by a waitress immediately asking if we were ready to order. No, but we could start with drinks. While I thumbed through the literally sticky pages of the menu, I asked for a thai iced tea with only a little bit of milk. A few minutes later I get a tea set down that is half milk and half tea. The waitress disappeared quickly. Finally when someone came back, I asked them to remake it with a little bit of milk. She brought back the same thing. Third try was a charm. (Best part about it is we were actually charged for multiple teas.) We had an appetizer set down and the waitress mumbled the name while walking away. Immediately after, I approached the waitress at the counter to ask for plates, napkins, and silverware.... how were we supposed to eat our appetizer? The entrees were served at separate times. We waited 10-15 minutes for a server to check in so that we could ask for boxes and the check.   Frustrating, because the food is decent.|review|WQxbkBR-XN8Fze4aTB690g|0|0|1

I have to say Giligin's really knows how to celebrate Halloween. The place was decorated to the tee, and even had smoke machines running all night, which gave this place a dingy, dark, and scary feel. The place is a total dive, and I think it would be pretty cool on a normal night. I don't even like Old Town that much, but dressed up like V for Vendetta, being behind a mask, made it tolerable.  Also, seeing all the females in their sexy costumes makes it all worth it. It is hilarious to have your ID checked in a costume, as the bouncer looked at my license, looked at my mask, and said ""go ahead, have fun"" I wished I had made a fake license with a picture of me in my mask (mental note for next year.... Halloween is all in the details)  Inside Gilian's it's cramped, and the ceiling are low, it's quaint and cozy, so be prepared to shuffle around people, and tables, and wait to get a drink. (They have food as well) The crowd is mellow, and the service is great. Since I had to drink using a straw (mask restriction) the bartender was laughing hysterically when I took a shot of Jack Daniel's through a straw. I have to say, it wasn't bad!   Overall I had a great experience, and people either loved or were scared of my costume. A lot girls needed to see what was ""under"" the mask to feel secure. One girl in response to my question ""what are you supposed to be,  wittily quipped   ""I'm the girl of your dreams"" , she  wasn't even close, but 5 points for cleverness ;)    I guess that blank look of the V mask, somewhere between half happiness, half anger, half sadness, disturbs people. I spent most of the night in ""character""  and thought it was a very interest experience to be behind a mask in public. Since no one can read you face, people interact with you so differently. Also, you don't have to worry about giving anything anyway from a facial expression.  as I proceeded to make my way out, my friends bought me a shot of Jager, (I hate Jager) I looked around and tried to pass it to someone else..a lucky patron. Bellied up to the bar was Jeff Spicoli, I offer him the shot, he takes, and we toast ""Aloha Mr. Hand!"" I figured if anyone would take a shot of the Jager, it was Spicoli...."|review|HfwO9GnaP-9VdI0afwgmrA|4|2|1

We just happened to part right next to Mabel's on Main.  I loved it as soon as I walked in.  It was one of those classic dark bars, playing somber 60's heartbreak song.  You know, drink all night long songs.  I loved it!  If only it had lasted all night.  Towards the end of the evening, the music had changed to more lively music.    I loved that all the wood was so dark, as well as the leather seats.  We sat against the wall in the raised area.  Service, I will say, was a bit slow.  We probably would have ordered more drinks if they had come quicker.  One good thing was that there was a yelp check-in offer.  I think it was buy 1 cocktail get one free.    We also ordered food.  We had the filet mignon tips....we had to send them back the first time, but when they came back, they were good.  I will be back!|review|kNO6w6EIKo8u6GSykOHBLA|4|3|5
2ceeU8e3nZjaPfGmLwh4kg|2007-09-11|F309YDO3LW7N5cLtv5iKdg|4|"This is THE place to go if you want to hate on Scottsdale with your friends. It can get somewhat crowded and you'll find more elbow room outside on the expansive patio, but I've never seen it wall-to-wall people. This is pretty much a well-known fixture of downtown Tempe and it's frequented by all sorts of artsy cool-type people. It's not your typical college bar. It's also not really some sort of locals-only club.   I tend to get tired of going there easily because my friends who consider themselves too cool for Scottsdale always mention either that or Bikini Lounge or some other Central Phoenix hipster dive. I also find that most people are much younger than me... it's not as bad as a lot of bars near the campus, but it's still pretty obvious. That could just be that I'm getting too old to go out though. Perhaps I should just stay inside.   I mean, I agree with my friends who think Scottsdale is full of douchebags, but I staunchly disagree with their belief that there's nowhere cool to go in Scottsdale. Scottsdale is littered with awesome non-douchebag places to go. I guess that's beside the point... almost... I guess I just think that a lot of people from Phoenix and Tempe see Scottsdale as being full of snobs (Snobbsdale) apart from the douchebaggy scene. It seems like they are always saying how lame Scottsdale is because everyone sucks and blah blah, but that kind of attitude just sounds to me like reverse snobbery. Like ""I'm too cool to hang in Scottsdale... "" Whatever.  So Casey Moore's - it's basically an old reliable pub. Not the easiest place to get a drink at, but it's a cool place to chill and drink and talk with friends without having to yell over techno beats or top 40 hits. The upstairs is supposedly haunted and the owners are constantly pissing off the neighborhood residents because it's hard to find parking and people are noisy on the patio. Shit, I just realized someone else described the patio as ""expansive"" also - well, whatever - it is.   If someone says ""hey, meet me in Tempe - where should we go?"" Casey Moore's is probably going to top the list for lack of anything much cooler."|review|Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg|1|2|3

Sitting in the bar area they offer a limited food menu at great prices.  We ordered the fries and chicken wings.  The fries came with three dipping sauces and all three were good.

EWnSPExh_T5zTv6oMJOC5g|2010-11-05|2HH3xyjb_1dFAw-kus79Gg|3|"Hit or miss, hence the 3 stars.  I've had meals there that make me feel that they warrant the ""Best Chinese Food in Ahwatukee"" title, and others that make me a little down that they couldn't be better.  This is one of those places where the waitstaff can switch from attentive to awkward, really positively or negatively affecting the meal.  I wish I could just objectively review the food for any restaurant, but if you forget my drink and to take my order while working the rest of the room (and I'm talking to you, Mr. Chao), then anything I eat afterwards is just not going to seem as good.  On a good night...I've had some of the yummiest potstickers I've ever had in Arizona (and beyond) - delicately flavored with the perfect amount of ginger and seared on the bottoms, I could have eaten 20 by myself.  Sesame Chicken is all white meat, crispy and perfectly sauced without being cloyingly sweet.  Mongolian Beef is tender and savory, over a crisp bed of noodles that add a great texture counterpoint.  Combination fried rice passed Mitch G's (and my) yellow rice test - large shrimp, tender beef and chicken, and the perfect amount of egg and diced veggies - I would eat a plate of just this easily and be a happy duck.  On a bad night...hot and sour soup touted as ""One of the best in the area"" was WAY too sour, oddly flavored, and full of huge chunks of semi-raw celery.  My husband took one bite and pushed it away, which left me struggling eating nasty soup for 4 people.  Beef with String Beans was overcooked, oversauced and tasted of Chinese 5-Spice powder more than anything else.  Huge disappointment.  Pomegranate martini was overly sweet, not at all strong, and a waste of a martini glass.  The decor is elegant, but a bit of a laugh.  They're trying to be modern, and while I love the specials written on the tile wall in the back of the place, the framed photos of salad greens is comical at best.  Just what I want to gaze at in a Chinese restaurant - chopped romaine.  I'm going to give Mr. Chao's another try because they are indeed ahead of the pack of other Chinese restaurants in the area, but there are some serious kinks in terms of reliability and consistency that need to be worked out."|review|vLMwisRi7IWPooI9YZ1znA|0|1|2

My biggest grip is that they fry their fish in the same fryer as their fries so the fries can have a hint of fish flavor on them, which isn't too bad but I don't eat seafood so it isn't too good either.

The joy of coming here is that the theatre itself is quite large, with plenty of seats to see whatever show may be playing here.  They seem to have really fair prices for tickets across the board, with a variety of seating options, so no one really gets priced out.  The downside, is that the parking here BLOWS, and it can get congested when entering and leaving.  Even though the upper level seats still give you a clear view, they are a bit far away, and I struggled at times with seeing details of the show itself.  Nothing really can be done about it now, but it kinda was a downer.  I would gladly return in the future for more shows at the gammage.  Thank you yelp!|review|JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg|3|2|3

I always make sure to steal a bite of Andy F's rocket burger (it's three patties! on a sub roll! so epic). Part of the fun of eating at Rocket Burger is spending way too long examining all the soda options - last time, I found a dandelion soda, but was just too chicken to try it (but YOU should - and tell me about it!)  The owners and staff are lovely, and you can tell they really care about this place. Andy and I actually had a really terrible experience our first time here (waited an hour + for food that was cold on arrival, etc), and when Andy yelped about it, the owner reached out. He said there was no excuse for the terrible service, but he'd instituted some changes and hoped we'd come back. We've been back a dozen times since that fateful day, and never once have we regretted it!   Well, I regret not having tried all the sodas.

I only had the pizza and thought it was delicious - it was the crust that made it super yummy as well as their wine coolers, but there was nothing fabulous that would have me coming back all the time. So when I went again, I knew I was in store for yummy pizza but not sure what else.   I, and a friend, went back on a busy night. There were people waiting, even outside on a cold rainy night. While we waited, we managed to find a place at the bar and grabbed a beer. The wait didn't seem long and we were seated at a booth. The service was awesome, which was expected since last time was awesome, regardless of knowing one of the bartenders who took care of my friend and I.   Anyways, we started off our meal with their BOH soup. From my experience, in general, BOH soup is always yummy and worth trying! And their soup was worth trying, although I wish their soup of the night had been a bit spicier, it was good. My friend also had moved on from the beer to the hibiscus wine cooler and it was super yummy. I do need to order that next time.   After the soup, we were going to get two pizzas but decided to try an app and a pizza. Experience from last time told me that two pizzas would not be even close to being finished. The app we went for was the Meatball Trio. I wanted to try it for the polenta, the meatballs we're just bonus. I really liked it! The crunch from the polenta with soft yummy meatballs and their marinara sauce was awesome. And the pizza we had - the Manifesto - was just as awesome! I'm not normally a fan of goat cheese or fennel, but on the pizza, it was delish.   And when we thought we had had enough, we decided on dessert. We got a cobbler. Now I'm not a fan of cobblers or fruit pies, but their cobbler was something I ate up. The crust and fruit filling was awesome and was served hot so eating it with ice cream was a must. I just wish there was another scoop of ice cream since the one scoop melted into the dessert lol.   I will make sure to keep coming back and easy my way through their menu :p|review|BgY9LwHmY8BO_lPI3pNRFQ|8|6|8

However, this full ""mock"" meat experience was pretty cool and enlightening.  Not only was the lil establishment very clean but the owner was super cool and informative.  Although I don't see myself converting to full veganism anytime soon, I'll definitely be back to try a few more vegan-mock meat dishes.  Boba Juice is also my new go to place for a much needed icy cold smoothie with boba of course. I've tried a few variations and my favorite is the taro/coconut smoothie, add boba.

I was looking for a centrally located place to live and still be in the ""nice"" side of central Phoenix. I have an AMAZING landlord who upgraded my 1 bedroom prior to my move in. I have only had one issue with my toilet leaking and they came out to fix it immediately. I live on the 1st floor and will say that my ceiling can be a bit noisy from my upstairs neighbors but it's not that bad. I am never home during the day and rarely on weekends so it doesn't bother much and it's not too overwhelming that you cannot fall asleep. The grounds are always kept clean and they have a cleaning service that cleans the entire grounds every morning. I feel very secure in this complex. I am a young, single woman who comes home at late hours in the night and have NEVER felt unsafe, even with the lonely Phoenix homeless people lurking around the corner by the local stores. I am a Phoenix native and feel so lucky I found a great condo at a great price. I am relocating to California and cannot find NEARLY as nice as a condo complex as Biltmore Square for a decent price. If you are single, married, young, or old...you will love living there. Every place you live in will have it's problems and it's a part of life, but, Biltmore Square is a safe, nice, and friendly environment to call home.

When our group of 8 entered this restaurant, I had very high hopes, The exposed brick and vents make the atmosphere very enticing, although a bit loud. We were seated right away, and our table was ready on time, so the experience started out well enough. However, it was all downhill from there.  First, the table was not at all conducive to socializing. The last time I checked, a group of 8 doesn't go out to dinner just for their health...they actually want to talk. It was basically as though we were four couples dining side by side with no room between our tables, if that makes sense. Each of the girls in the group sat on the bench, while the guys sat on the chairs...again, you could really only talk to the person across from you or right next to you. That was annoying, and I am also blaming that for the urge I felt to go out afterwards, which lead to the hangover I have today.  Anyway, it then took at least 10 minutes for our drink orders to be taken and another 10 minutes for them to arrive. The service was just not quick or friendly for that matter. I suppose the waiter was knowledgeable, as he did correct me in my pronunciation of the dish I ordered, but he sure didn't appear very on the ball throughout our meal. My husband had the duck, which was okay - he wasn't raving about it. It said ""crispy,"" which it wasn't really, so that disappointed him. I ordered a pasta dish, which was basically a bowl of salt. Sure, it had capers and olives, but it was WAY too many capers and olives. If I had been in the mood for pure olives, I would have ordered the appetizer bowl of them. I ate the dish because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either.  The meal was not correctly paced, and none of the food I tasted impressed me. I tried Kristin's scallops, and they were way overcooked. I tasted my husband's duck, and while I don't like duck anyway, it didn't even have a good flavor or sauce.

When I arrived, I was told they did not have any available (hooray for making reservations) ... I was offered a King in a smoking room or 2 queens in a non-smoking room. I settled on the 2 queen option and hustled along outside to get in my car and told to follow some guy. Along the way he pointed at the elevator I was supposed to take and he guided me to a parking space that was a pretty decent walk from the aforementioned elevator.  Once I parked and retrieved my own luggage, he shouted at me from his car asking if ""I even wanted a hand..."" I told him I could probably manage. After he left, I realized he never gave me a the map I asked for.   The room was underwhelming. There was no refrigerator or safe which forced me to walk back to my car to secure my valuables and settle for less than chilled beverages for the evening.  I later found that some of my friends who bought the same package as me were provided with vouchers for breakfast ( I wasn't) and they even got the room they reserved... Lucky them.    I had a fabulous view of another room's balcony the was probably about 25 feet directly across from mine. So much for those award winning views...  Frankly I'm not sure how they justify charging so much. There are plenty of great hotels in the valley that will provide you with more amenities for less money. I won't be staying here again."|review|-2EuoueswhqEERWezJY8gw|0|0|5

There were many other unique cocktails on the menu, such as the bacon infused bloody mary, that I am dying to return to try.  The menu is inbetween bar and restaraunt type selections.  I had the shaved rib sandwhich with french onion soup for dipping.  It was excellent.  The decor in culinary dropout is posch with dark purple walls and large chandeliers, which is complimented by their tattooed and mo-hawked staff.

But what fun was this!  A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon. We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making!   My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways!  For one we did not have to get all that dirty. Not dirty at all really. Also not that I mind dirty. This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go.  And two - we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena.  Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey. The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate (or item of the bride to be's choice) which we will then give to her as a wedding present. I thought this idea was really original.  So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked. All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works.  Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation. The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way. We finished about 4 hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity.  Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted. I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs - but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon :)  Go go here for a stimulating outing with good friends/family/kids!|review|uZG-IiG2fE7LSoEtlWp2Sw|0|0|0

I would suggest the Baked Potato Salad, waffle fries and the onion tanglers.  For the meats, go for the brisket, pulled pork, ham and turkey.  You have 3 choices of BBQ sauce, Original, sweet and spicy.  They are all good.  The meats are juicy and they come without sauce added so you can add as little or as much as you want.

I was disappointed that they do not have the flatbreads any more but the goat cheese is simply divine.  Also had the key lime pie for dessert.  I must say it was so amazingly delicious I can't wait to have it again!  Another disappointment was that they did not have the shots of dessert.

DxUn-ukNL27GOuwjnFGFKA|2011-02-14|4AINmjYl3gpkVHpH7s_NHQ|5|My family and I have been regular patrons of this restaurant since before yelp even existed!! The owner, Hiro-san, is the friendliest man ever :)  When I was a little girl he would used to carve me flowers and animals out of carrots in his spare time to keep a bored kid in an adult's dinner party happy and occupied. Now that the restaurant's so successful he has barely any time to make it in and out of the kitchen! But he never fails gives us a huge grin and welcoming wave whenever he sees us.  The staff here is so friendly that when I walk in the doors I always feel at ease.  It's the same feeling as returning home to food and an experience that I KNOW is going to be amazing and satisfying.  Now on to the food...my family and I come to this restaurant AT LEAST once every month.  Since this place is a must-go whenever we have guests visiting, and we've had numerous guests visit us this past month, we have been to HIro's once every week!  Even with all the frequent dining at this restaurant for so many years, we're never tired of it because it is JUST THAT GOOD.  The food is authentic (as I already knew but again confirmed by my visiting friends from Japan) and the quality very fresh.  The following is a list of our favorites:  - miso soup- no explanation necessary :) - spicy tuna roll - catepillar roll- ADORABLE looking and everyone whose had it swears it's delicious.  I believe them but I don't eat eel so I've never tried it. - toro- excellent quality!! - hiyayakko- cold tofu with bonito flakes paired with scallions and ginger.  Pour some soy sauce over it and you have a light, healthy, but tasty appetizer. - nasumiso- miso glazed eggplants. You can't go wrong with this one, trust me. - hamachi kama- yellowtail collar.  The meat is so tender and the sauce they have with it totally makes the dish.  Be sure to squeeze some lemon on it as well! - dynamite- a seafood mix baked in a special sauce.  This is a dish you won't see elsewhere.  It's very rich but also very unique. - halibut carpaccio- raw sliced halibut with sliced scallions and tomatoes.  They pour hot oil over it to half-cook it.  Kind of Italian-Japanese fusion, and very creative! - zaru soba- authentic Japanese soba noodles. Refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. - green tea ice cream- if you're feeling up to desert, definitely give this a try.  Green tea is my personal favorite and it's actually hard to find good quality ice cream in that flavor!  Their GT ice cream is definitely NOT the cheap gross ones I've unfortunately purchased once at a supermarket...  That should be enough to get you started! There are so many more great dishes I could list but these are the ones we always come back to :)  Branch out and give everything a try! This would be the place to try new things because you can be at ease knowing that anything you order will be of a certain caliber. We tried the sesame roll for the first time yesterday and it was surprising, creative, and delicious.  :)  Hopefully my super long, and way overdue review of this restaurant will convince you to go try it out, or even just try some new dishes!  Now go make your reservation...I promise you won't be disappointed!!|review|PMDOLWbppQa28B3Emi-Pgg|0|0|1

When I arrived, I saw the Yelp group drinking beers and eating bar food, and I thought, ""Oh, this place must have some specials going. I mean, it IS Sunday night.""  To the contrary, the grub was pricey. Burgers were $9. I settled on some onion rings ($6), which really were good. Maybe I've been spoiled in Chicago, where drinking on a Sunday or Monday will get you dollar burgers, dollar beers and free snacks.  I did notice they split a huge bill among several Yelpers who wanted to use credit cards. Most places won't do that.  Also, if you're looking for the soap in the men's room, it's in a squeezie bottle. It makes no sense atop the futuristic granite sink. What's up with that?"|review|z5g5Lclwt13_BO0BStohMA|5|4|3

The ""Classic Dinner"" options state that they come with Caesar salad, mixed vegetables, and baked potato, but they are very accommodating and you can easily substitute another salad and/or potato choice.  The wedge salad is great, assuming you enjoy bleu cheese... the bacon-wrapped filet, well, what can I say - when you wrap one kind of meat with another kind of meat, you can't go wrong!  Even the standard baked potato was delish.  For dessert, they have these great shot glass desserts that would give you just a taste of something sweet, but of course I had to go all out and get a full-sized dessert.

This place is AMAZING!The BEST Chinese food I've had in a very very long time. My boyfriend and I were craving some Chinese and sick of all of the mediocre delivery places in the area so we turned to yelp (of course) to help us find something new.... we found this place w really good reviews and decided to give it a shot. At first site it is a clean and comfortable casual dining space. Brightly painted modern walls and plenty of two or four person tables. Up front there are some seats occupied by people waiting for  their scrumptious take out. You are greeted nicely by someone who will seat you then get drinks for you (even though there is a soda machine and you can do it yourself) The menu is filled with terrific beef, chicken, pork,duck,lamb and seafood options. Here is the great part, it's not your typical fast food Chinese place the dishes are really restaurant quality.We started with the egg rolls because quite a few reviews mentioned how fresh they were. We got one egg roll and one shrimp egg roll. They were so fresh the cabbage was still crispy. Best egg rolls ever!Then we moved on to the sizzling rice soup which was chock full of large shrimp chicken and pork and freshly added veggies.  I had the szechuan chicken and my boyfriend had the jalapeno steak. The portions are not only generous and like 8 bucks they are prepared so fresh that the veggies are still crisp my favorite. The chicken dish had broccoli, red peppers, onions,water chesnuts,baby corn,mushrooms and the presentation is beautiful.. big pieces of sliced meat, large  veggies nothing diced.The sauces are full of flavor, not salt you can both see and taste your entrees. The jalapeno steak was super delicious and spicy very, very good. It had green peppers, jalapeno peppers, onions, red peppers, chili flakes and some smokey and spicy delicious sauce. I was kind of jealous i'll probably get that next time. Overall this is the best Chinese in Phoenix. They could easily charge 12 bucks a plate. Phoenix needs more locations, let's help them expand!!!|review|lmEkgFvoBC5uWp4RclMK-A|0|0|1

Since being with FORD, I've had multiple auditions ranging from SAG film to industry videos. My son has also had multiple auditions and has booked a web video and 2 commercials. Yes, in case you're wondering when my son booked his commercials, he jumped up and down with excitement and of course, as his mom I grinned from ear to ear with happiness for him!   FORD has a stellar international reputation and the local agency FORD Robert Black Agency of Arizona is no exception. They are one of the few SAG agencies.

Beautifully landscaped, a super way to enjoy an relaxing Sunday afternoon or anytime during the week if you are in the area!|review|ru8p3RTlk8f9LB_3zLXURQ|0|0|0

Didn't have much time and could only try one place and settled on Joe's.  What a treat!  I had the BBQ Bacon Blue Cheee Burger...Amazing.  My DH had the BBQ chicken Pizza.  Both were nicely flavored, not overwhelming but done perfectly.  We had a few sides...Baked Potato Fries and Onion rings.  Tasty.  Not overly greasy and great flavor.  We sat outside under lovely fragrant citrus trees as the sun set.  If it wasn't for the idiot children climbing the trees and throwing the lovely fruit against anything they could find...it would have been perfect a perfect night. But Kudos to the staff for stepping in and doing the job of the horrible parents .  They were asked not to climb the trees and told they could only take fruit they could reach.  After wandering around the property and snapping a few pictures we made our way back for some rice pudding and hot fudge sundae.  Had 2 bites of the rice pudding just to try it but not impressed.  Overly seasoned with cinnamon, but not bad.  The toasted pecans on the ice cream were magnificent and the chocolate sauce wasn't amazing, but something about it hit the spot and we enjoyed it.  I wouldn't go back for dessert, but the atmostphere & menu has made it's way into my top 10 restaurants of all time.  I'd almost drive 5 hours again just for dinner.  But we'll be back next year.  ;-)|review|BrIYYxVB51DuOTfuasNV4g|3|1|3

The restaurant has a swanky but relaxed feel, with a cool and tranquil, very minimal decor. There were serious diners along side parents with their children. Westley our knowledgeable server was super helpful and very cool. A great ambiance.  The open charcoal grill looks wonderful as does all the kitchen. What could be more fitting than work of art vegetable offerings in lovely bowls all along the robata open counter. All the chefs too, look very good.  Time to let the cuisine take center stage. I started out this evening with the Butterfish Takaki $11. The cooked butterfish tataki melted in your mouth while the white asparagus and yuzu shallot dressing finished out the flavor. I order crispy Brussels Sprouts with shallots and bonito tuna. $6.50. A large serving of simple, tender and delicious.  It's time for our entree, our 'pièce de résistance'. Grilled Lamb Cutlets. $28.50. Three tender, juicy Korean spiced chops on the bone, probably 3 to 4 ounces apiece.   I also asked for a presentation of traditional side dishes. The chef served cremini skewered mushroom caps $4.50. Sweet corn on the cob, chopped down to 4 inch little triangle cuts $4.50 and half moon skewered yellow zucchini $4.50.   Everything was served on rustic stone plates, all served in harmony to create an exquisite experience.|review|gN03qFYysM5DbgjuV6N0QQ|3|1|7

Prices are very reasonable, they have unique specials, a varied menu, and a great staff. I'm there 2x a week and am always greeted warmly.

After reading reviews on yelp the wife and I decided to check it out. Great little place very friendly people. We were escaping our inferno of an apartment, the ac was not performing up to our igloo like standards. So, we put a bunch of ice in the dogs water bowls and went off on our new yelp adventure.  Pizza A Metro was a great choice. They gave us tons of water to calm our sweltering hearts and served us amazing food.  To start a pizza crust cut up served with a cold onion bruschetta (the best i can describe) it was very good, but I could not eat a lot of it, however the wife loved it.  Salad: next we shared their least expensive salad, nice leafy spring mix with onions,  tomato's, and a tangy italian dressing (i would order it on the side in the future) Very good and was more then enough for both of us.  Entree: She had a Margherita pizza which she added olives to. She ordered the small and it will last her two lunches in leftovers. I was a bit surprised to see the olives cost an extra $1.50 but other than that she loved it, and I enjoyed it as well. I had the home made Gnocchi, which were very good, and very filling. It comes with your choice of sauce, I ordered the four cheese sauce (how could you not) it was excellent, but if I had to do it again I would get a red sauce with it.  Please go there support them they are worth it. We have been searching for a pizza place in the downtown area, and I believe this is the champion!!!!|review|fwTcRziQWLR61LDDm_NxYw|4|0|5

You would never tell driving up to the front, but this place does it right. I believe Yoli does all of the cooking so when it gets busy, be prepared to be patient. They share an awesome courtyard with another new place called the Perch Brewery and they have a bunch of rescued exotic birds. Our daughters love to come to this place just to see the birds, but the real reason we keep going back is the food. The service is good as well, but don't forget you may have to wait for a table and then be patient for your food...it is well worth the wait!|review|__YwS4PKWJQ2ECfOXyKzYA|2|0|2

I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of ""market-made granola"" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)  I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)  p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!    Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??  Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt."|review|0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ|11|7|13

GMkgJsA2Jg6kTnOzF5Rf8Q|2013-10-04|bA83SEYX3Td-P5PcSSCQcQ|2|Never consistent.   I was in twice this week. On my first visit I ordered a potato, chicken nuggets and a kids size frosty. I paid at the first window and when I reached the second they tried to collect money from me, when I informed her I already paid at the first window she asked if I was sure that I already paid. I wasn't OK with her implying I was lying about paying for my lunch. After all that confusion they handed me my lunch, told me to have a nice day and I drove away. One I got about 10 feet ahead I realized they never handed me my frosty but at this point it was too late. A car was already at the window and since it's lunch time the parking lot was a disaster and I wasn't going back.   My second visit was yesterday, I ordered a kids meal but it didn't have a toy inside. While this isn't a huge deal to me since it was for myself. But, if I had a kid in the back seat waiting on a toy, I'd be pretty upset.   In previous visits I'm usually missing an item 2 out of 5 times.

The computer showed that we booked the room in February and cancelled it 1 day later. Obviously, it was a mistake so for our trouble Marie upgraded us. Sweet:)  I'm sitting in our large room while my husband is sleeping soundly in the comfortable, king size bed. The hotel is clean and more modern than not.   Here are some useful hotel facts: * Starbucks is in the lobby (closes early Sat and closed on Sun) * Valet parking is $23 per day. * The on-site fitness is adequate if you do more cardio than lifting. There is a Gold's Gym about a block away. Show them your keycard and you can use their facility free of charge. * Free wifi. * Most restaurants in the area close early during the week and close completely on the weekend.  We are on the 18th floor and fortuantely, we don't have any neighbors or an adjoining door. Other reviewers have mentioned the paper thin walls, guess we got lucky cuz I'm a light sleeper and that would really annoy me.

Every one of them did not address my issue or concerns. They were outsourced from a company I have worked for as a full time employee and a eventually a freelance contractor. I never received my 1099 misc forms from this company since 2011. As a freelancer I need these documents to file my taxes. I have emailed and tried numerous times to address my concerns to get what I needed. Nothing in return but an estimate of how much I have made! I am not looking for an estimate for I keep records of income myself and know exactly how much I have made and each project I have completed for each company. I am requesting my 1099 misc form that I have always received every year before (before the company I worked for hired them) Having a 1099 misc form sent to me to file taxes is a way to document every single piece of income and makes it easier to report to the IRS.I may not be an expert with taxes or accounting but I know what to expect when this time of year comes. When the company I worked for outsourced to EK Tax & Accounting, I never received my checks on time AND never received my 1099 misc forms for the last 2 years. This has been the first time having to deal with this and I have been a freelancer for the last 8 years. it has become utterly frustrating to deal with this. Taxes are enough of a pain to file and for them to make it more difficult on us contractors is just a disadvantage.  I would not recommend them personally for your business or professionally.

If you are understanding of the culture you know that time is unimportant, the food is why your there. I asked for a usual Moroccan drink and the owner brought out a unique beverage that i can only say you have to try just to try it. At the end of a fantastic meal I again  asked what a usual dessert is and she came out with a wonderful seminola flour pastry with her own homemade cream filling bathed in honey, WOW!

It was warm, buttery, and grilled.  I ordered the raspberries salad with Fossil Creek goat cheese.  I added some chicken for protein.  I also shared the BLT.  The sandwich was good.  The potato salad that came with the sandwich was yummy.  I couldn't resist ordering dessert so I ordered the key lime pie.  It was delicious!  It wasn't too sweet and the crust had toasted coconut flakes.  Overall, the food was fresh and of high quality.  Most of the patrons were woman.  I don't blame them.  I would be here on a Saturday morning shooting the breeze with my friends if I lived closer.  Arcadia Farms is really cute.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.

The music is blasting so loud that you have to yell across the table to your companion - definitely not a pleasant dining experience. - 2 stars.  The girls (yeah, I've NEVER had a male waiter or host here) are pleasant enough but service is a bit slow. - 1 star.  On the other hand, the food is good and really reasonably priced - I recall Happy Hour being around $18 for a couple iced teas, Vegas Rolls, and a few other rolls, having some left to take home even. Otherwise, it was $36 for dinner the last time I went.  So, as a compromise the last time Ra was suggested, I dragged my oh-so-tolerant date to the Ahwatukee location. It was MUCH QUIETER and the service was surprisingly good, despite it being 10 pm on a Saturday with a packed bar. It was worth the 5 miles to Ray and I-10, because the sushi is definitely good.|review|ysINNe8YpbOW_-5T5CSyhw|0|0|1

Great happy hour specials on food and booze   - $3 for 6 fat crab puffs, can't go wrong!

I hadn't been here since college which was a lifetime ago.  So glad we came here.  It was really good.  You pick different various meats, veggies, noodles, sauces and they grill it all for you. I totally packed in the bowl.  The price also includes a beverage, side of rice (they have both brown and white), and desert afterwards.  What a deal!

I ordered a pasta dish which included chicken, peppers, and a creamy tomato-based sauce. It was good, but I don't know if it was $14 good. Prices went up from there for the various fish dishes, but I can't really judge those without trying them.

I have timed my ""drive-thru waits,"" as I call them, because they times have become so ridiculous (almost as ridiculous as the outcomes of  my visits here).    Some examples of these waits include (but are certainly NOT limited to) 34 minutes to pick up my rx, only to be told they have no record of it after I got a text message saying it was ready....waiting over 20 minutes in the drive-thru to drop off an rx only to go inside and drop off my rx at the counter with no wait where there are NO other customers waiting....I have even waited to go here until two days after an rx was supposed to be ready (just to make sure it was REALLY ready), only to be told it was not ready and that it could be ready in 45 minutes if I ""just wanted to wait.""  Really???  Oh yeah, and don't let me forget to mention that they're incompetence is only exceeded by their RUDENESS...

This means I'm going to be arriving at your bar later in the evening.   We walked in at around 11. We ordered two glasses of wine, paid for them and plopped down on a couch to relax. At exactly 12 on the dot, they turned off the music and turned up the lights. One manager came over to ask if we were finished. I looked at my 1/4 filled glass and said No.  Another bartender comes over and asks if we were finished. Still no. But he chose to stand there and watch us while we finished the last few sips.  Aside from the weird ambiance (is it a lounge? A bar? A sports bar?) the way were treated was beyond rude and unacceptable.   I will never return and I will tell everyone I know not to come here.

That's not a bad thing, just an observation.  I met a woman who told me that if she was my age again she would not be hanging out at Blue Martini.  Another guy asked me if I was twelve, so you can see why I bring up the whole age thing.  On a side note- I was barely buzzed, so I don't think I was acting twelve.    Another thing I observed, three woman (not girls) dancing on a counter and posing ""seductively"" for photos.  They took at least fifteen shots of just their butts.  They were some classy bitches.   What else, three people confused my male friend for a female.  Yeah, he really needs to cut his hair, he is just too darn pretty!  Seriously, his hair could star in a Vidal Sassoon commercial.  He even scored a ladies VIP card.  Good times.  The night was capped by witnessing the saddest drunk I have ever seen.  I thought that maybe I had accidentally teleported to Vegas or Rocky Point, but no, I was still in a parking lot in AZ.  He had his pants around his ankles, a bloody knee and dirt all over his face.  I guess he fell down a few times?  He couldn't get his pants up to save his life, seriously, I actually tried to help him I felt so bad.  He kept mumbling something about medical school.  Ah, the children of tomorrow.  Anyway, someone finally claimed him.    What else?  The waitresses all wear bustiers.  I once went on a Thursday night and they had a live band.

It has a relaxed feel, and a far more spacious dining area than the other Tempe location.  The Pasty is a unique little pocket of delight!  Originating as traditional miner's fare in Cornwall, England, the Pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting, nontraditional Pasties upon it's arrival to Tempe, AZ.  Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try!  For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger.  There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.  Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!  Aside from the yummy pasties, the setting of The Cornish Pasty is cozy and fun.  The Jukebox there is awesome....playing everything, classic rock, psychedelic, new wave, etc.  At night, the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.  They have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a long indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.  The staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.  They serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.  I love the Pasty and I love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious!

The food is simply wonderful, I recommend trying the Southwest Corn bread appetizer to start off the evening and all of the entrees are extraordinarily well done. I have dined at Bandera numerous times with everyone from in-laws to business associates trying numerous dishes including fish, chicken, lamb, and steaks. The lamb will melt in your mouth, the chicken is wonderful, and the steaks enchilada style are sizzling in more ways than one!   It's been a wonderful experience each time as far as the food and the atmosphere. The lighting is wonderful, it casts a very warm flattering glow over the ugliest of my friends and it is definitely a place to take a date or celebrate with friends. Well over 95% of the time the service is spot on, they are responsive, friendly, accurate, etc.  but there have been a few small preventable mistakes (the nights in question were very busy so it is somewhat understandable).|review|eatsTYGR2CNM-Huxgm_TVw|2|1|4

Being a teetotaler, I can't vouch for the wines myself, but as a foodie I can address the non-alcoholic choices at Kokopelli's:  On the downside, the limited menu consists mostly of salads and Panini sandwiches, which are admittedly average. The French Onion soup is quite good, however, and the chocolate strawberries are to die for (then again, how can you screw up chocolate & strawberries?). Other pluses are the large portions and the live jazz on weekends.

If you feel that you have entered a garage sale/thrift store, you have found your refuge.  Your synapses will be overloaded as you take in the random yet tasteful decorum.  The classy plastic Statue of Liberty tugs at your patriotic heartstrings and the tinsel covered atrium makes everyday feel like Cinco de Mayo.  Simply smelling the tantalizing food was almost satisfying enough, which was perfect because I was only interested in the margaritas.  Liquid diet.  Prickly pear pitcher of margaritas is a steal of a deal and was empty all too soon.|review|NPuSbODFKilOljfVuBW0ww|1|1|3

This particular location offers fantastic service, and has such long-tenured employees they have to have a PHD in sandwhich artistry.  If you could get above a PHD they would have this distinction.

We were looking at $1,025 parts and labor. After we discussed it with the mechanic we were resolved to our fate. However, the mechanic went the extra mile after we left and looked more into it, on top of the 3 hours he had already spent. He found it was a bad crank sensor replaced and the computer worked.  They could have gone ahead with the expensive repair and replaced the $20 sensor unbeknownst to me but they didn't. They spent at least 4 hours diagnosing my jeep for a $232 repair. This is not my 1st time taking my jeep to this shop and they have had the opportunity time and time again to charge me for an expensive repair when it was something cheap. They are an honest shop.|review|l-o5u_6qbApVylEMWZOrvg|0|0|0
MAfc2V_EVtyR9rMxxEAPLg|2010-11-27|MVYT40ITn8IE_j9r5KtiGQ|3|This place used to be my place to go for pho, but then I had a bad experience (the water tasting funny and the veggies not being so fresh) and decided to try some other places.  (This was during the summer however and I will say that based on the 6 years of living here in Tempe, many of the restaurants that stay open during the summer start to falter with the quality and freshness of their food.  A problem which I hope will be rectified this summer.)   But, given that it has been quite chilly lately and school is still in, I recently decided to give this place another try.  I agree with all the other reviews about this place.  The pho, the portions, the price, and the service are all very good.  No problems with the freshness of the veggies this time.  But I am still adverse to the water (I think it is non-filtered tap water) and one of the lettuce leaves that came with my egg rolls still had some dirt on it.    Also, note that this place, given the weather and its size, was packed during the usual lunch hour when I visited.  But, the table turnover was pretty quick and you only have to wait a few minutes if at all to get a table.  But, you might have to share a table with someone if you are a single.|review|uO3pavwCb8ylw-aog3Mn6w|1|0|1

My family in particular was impressed with the Shanghai pork, which we had ordered on a whim but ended up being one of our favorites.

Finally it seems we have found it.  We have eaten here quite a few times and while it is not the fanciest restaurant they do simple Chinese food really well. The owner is almost always there and extremely friendly and the food is tasty.  I have found the Lo Mien and the Mongolian Beef to be outstanding. The garlic chicken and Moo Shu shrimp are favorites as well.  They do deliver but I have almost always found it faster to go in and pick it up.  So, If you are looking for some simple yet very tasty Chinese food, I highly recommend this place. It is nice to have them in the neighborhood.|review|WzT1iB5k73t-7NYWG7Rcuw|2|0|2

The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here.

Se76m2u-a14hB4x-QyxdmQ|2011-03-21|6sYAIYEAfxpFodDQwaiEyA|5|I will say that this is my first tailoring experience... but I must say, I love this place. I have now had four pairs of jeans taken in at the waist and legs. Honestly because of this lady, I now buy my jeans a size too big and add $20 onto their price tag because I know I will want them altered to fit ME.  It's astonishing how wonderful she is at tailoring your clothes.   One of the jeans I brought in had to be roughly 2 sizes too big. She fitted them to me and then when I went to pick them up the next week, I still wasn't 100% happy with the fit. She said she would re-alter them at no extra cost. I am sure this is standard procedure in the business, but she was quite wonderful about the whole thing. I was going to leave without trying them on, but she encouraged me to try each pair on so she could see the fit as well.   To get my jeans taken in at the waist, it is a flat rate of $20. To get my legs taken in, it is again a flat rate of $20. To have the hem taken up or down, it is usually $10.  It is always around a week turnover time; I have brought in 3 items at a time and at a different time 1 item, and both took a week.  This all being said, I dig the flat rates. If I bring in jeans with a small alteration or I bring in a pair 2 sizes too big, I am grateful to know what I am going to pay, always. There is no funny business with her. She is straightforward and cares about her customers.   As I said, I now buy jeans with the expectation that she will tailor them. I wouldn't be happy with the look of my clothing otherwise.|review|F0-xvsvWf32mYsxY85eOdQ|0|0|0

The burrito was about as good as I have had with options of 4 sauces, we did the read chili and green chili hollandaise. The sauces were delicious and the burrito was just the right amount of eggs, cheese, potatoes and ham not too much of any one ingredient. The french toast was done from a baguette with a side of some sort of cream cheese dish and fresh strawberries. The french toast was a little on the plain side it felt like it needed more batter or something, but it was good in its simplicity. The server was really sweet and genuine as well.

It's tame, it looks classy, and it's pretty much the opposite of the seediness and lameness that your straight friends probably expect out of a gay bar.  Just don't go on any day other than friday or saturday, or you're probably gonna walk right in the middle of a drag show (too often at this bar in my opinon).  The inside bar is cool if you can get a seat, but tends to be too loud if you aren't drunk yet.  The back patio is my favorite area when the weather is nice...you can watch the crowd and videos and hang out with larger groups of friends.  The Miami dance club is a little pointless; it's too small to actually dance, and is a really awkward space that would probably make a better lounge.  The bottom line is that Amsterdam is a great place to start out the evening on a Saturday, then head to Burn for some dancing later in the evening (it's close enough to walk from here) and let loose.  If it's just you and a bunch of straight friends (or conservative gay friends), stay here.|review|4ISG7_E0jmpjIZlBBtZnQQ|2|0|2

It's surprisingly uncrowded for such a nice little Mexican spot. Granted, it's new, and I hear their other location does pretty well so maybe they just need a little while to get their following in this neighborhood.

Went to grab some food from the local gas station because everything was closed. Started eating while changing channels on the tv. Then I looked at the control. Big mistake. It was gross. But whatever, I'll just wash my hands and won't touch it.  Next morning I go to take a shower. Turn on the bathtub faucet(transfers pressure to shower head) and I a hear a loud noise coming from it. Then BAM! the faucet flew off. It didn't just fall off the water pressure blew it off. Good thing I wasn't in the shower at the time. I hesitantly put it back on lightly so it would some what stay and showered quickly as to avoid taking a faucet to the shin or perhaps even the crotch area.  I mentioned this to the managers when checking out and asked if I could receive a discount because of this. They said I could not because I booked through Priceline.   Two lessons learned:  1) always book through the hotel. They will match the price.   2) Stay at this hotel at your own risk.

I saw that they had the typical Green & Red runny, mild Salsa and some Chunky Spicy Salsa...yes!  I like spicy, so I grabbed a few cups and filled them up.  Slight problem though...the cups for the Salsa were the soft, paper like cups typically used for Ketchup & Mustard.  You're probably wondering why that's a problem?  Well, it's because when you fill it up with Salsa, it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place....yep, it was very messy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA#g1dj4KmtgcSb0p46KFcaHA  The food came out a short while later and I started with the Carne Asada Taco....it is a pretty big portion for Street Tacos.  The portion size was the only positive though....the meat was bland....and the Guacamole and Pico de Gallo that was on the Taco didn't help much.  Next was the Carnitas Taco.  This one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the Carne Asada....however, it was average at best.  Last but not least was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  This was very good.  Some Mexican Joints like these have oily BRC Burritos...but not here.  There was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The Tortilla was very good as well.  Overall, my experience here was average...3 Stars.  If I do come back, it would be strictly for the BRC Burrito.  Return Factor - 50%"|review|kGgAARL2UmvCcTRfiscjug|5|2|6

I had the honey turkey omelette made with local turkey sausage.  My fellow diner had eggs benedict with chorizo instead of the traditional slice of ham.  Overall, the menu had all the breakfast staples, plus some inspired options and it was all delicious.    It was also the attention to detail that won us over.  They brought  us fresh berry compote and whipped butter for our toast instead of the pre-packed individual servings found on the tables at most restaurants.  Even a slice of cucumber in the water was a nice touch!    I would definitely dine here again.  Great food, good atmosphere, and fair prices.|review|MryuzVHjV1hvAyz33iA1jg|1|1|1

It was interesting. Interesting enough that I thought it might work. Yelpers are pretty supportive of this place, and they tend to be a picky lot. ""I'll check it out,"" I thought.  It still took me a few weeks. I was out of town for one, and then it was Sunday and they weren't open, and then we were broke.  I now consider those weeks wasted. I finally went today. Just about 45 minutes ago. And it was ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS. I had the Mahaka, a beef brat with things like ""Maui Pico"", ""Maui Mustard"", avocado, pepperoncinis and bacon. All of it on a perfectly crafted bun (the owner told me he has them specially made, and the cost is more than most restaurant's entire hot dog).  Anyway, it was a luau in my mouth, and everyone was invited.  I'm not often an evangelical for restaurants. If I like a place, I'll let people know in passing, ""Oh, hey, St. Francis is really good"" and whatnot. Before I even left Maui Dog, I was texting every Phoenician I knew telling them they needed to hit up Maui Dog as soon as humanly possible.  Oh, and it's cheap, too. And there are burgers and sliders and fresh cut fries and wings. And Hawaiian shaved ice. Seriously, stop reading...get over there.  There's only one thing I don't like, which is that it's Saturday, so I can't go eat there again tomorrow."|review|sMgt2JAQ85nz59Woe0IAtw|1|1|1

We've eaten in and out and at various SONY locations but this is one closest to our house and one we have TRIED to order for delivery quite a few times and each time we've been let down.  Tonight's order was, yet again, another let down with cold food, a long time delivery (quoted an hour max and we were wondering if we were going to get our food at the hour 15 mark), a big tab (me, hub and small child) and, well, a disengaged driver.  It is what it is... I fear we are running out of boutique-y pizza places in our area - the big chains aren't great but doggone-it they are consistently hot, timely and meet the expectation.  I love supporting local businesses but I shouldn't have to sacrifice quality for my money... right?  The positive - whatever frozen cake that gets thawed enroute - we enjoyed that.

Not sure why I haven't written one in the more than five years since I've been coming to Greek Wraps, but better late then never. I LOVE this place. I've had Greek, Turkish and various Arabic cuisines in many cities and several countries, and the stuff they serve here is right up there with the most flavorful I've ever had.  Primarily, the fact that they make their own bread fresh to order is what gets me salivating when it's coming close to lunchtime. They have 7"" pitas or thinner 10"" wraps. I get the latter. They're delicious. I'll either get a chicken kabob or shawarma wrap, typically with a side of falafels and a side of dolmas (vine/grape leaves). Their vine leaves are the cold vegetarian versions; none of that disgusting hot stuff with pine nuts and meat. Falafels are excellent - they don't taste store-bought and sludgy but have great flavour with a very nice, subtle peppery aftertaste. The shawarma is fantastic - marinated enough to give it a delicious zing. Me eating a wrap is like putting a piece of paper in a shredder - I absolutely decimate the thing nonstop from start to finish and have to watch out that I don't chew my own fingers off towards the end. I've had baklava once or twice from here, it's not too bad either. And thank god they don't serve ridiculous Chicago-style hotdogs here. Last I checked, Chicago wasn't in Greece.  Greek Wraps has always been extremely popular, especially at lunchtime, and it was always way overcrowded. The ""Jersey Shore"" (cracked me up) dudes prepping the food work pretty furiously but still it takes quite a while to get your meal, sometimes 10-15 minutes or longer. Toward the end of last year they did a MUCH-needed renovation and pretty much doubled the interior space - I remember walking in and then doing a doubletake since I didn't recognize any of it. Even with the added space it's still almost always full up at midday. Great prices, the absolute best Mediterranean take-out on the west side (I like Pita Jungle equally, but that's a different range/style of foods) and well deserving of your cashola. For dessert, assuming you have room (typically unlikely), you got your choice of a Jamba Juice or a Juju Berri in the same strip, or else walk across the carpark to Cost Plus World Market and pick up a coupla import chocolates like Milka Nussini or Cadbury Flake. Mmm.  Edit 20110615: BLEAH!! T Greek Wraps now stocks the infamous Abali ""yoghurt soda"" which I first tried at Haji Baba's down in Tempe. Disgusting - BUT!! I was super excited to see it and actually bought a bottle to drink. Do not ask me why. I grimace every time I take a swallow of it, but maybe I like it because of the Warhead effect - some sort of mild endorphin rush you get from challenging your taste buds to something they aren't thrilled with. Anyway, add another imaginary star to my review just for this stuff alone. See my pic. http://j.mp/jIYTCK"|review|6G8vLJUi1Ees2qC3RGA3Nw|0|0|2

I have been nothing but disappointed up to this point.  Everyone claims to have NYC Chinese and none of it is even close.  I just happen to be in chandler and happen to stop by this place.  It was a toss up between the safe bet (the bbq spot next door) and this joint.  After carful thought I decided to give this place a try.    Everything about the inside reminded me of home but I need to try the food to be sure.  I ordered the basics; shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  To my surprise, the food resembled NYC Chinese food!  The orange chicken looked normal, not like sweet and sour chicken balls.  The sauce had orange peals and red chili peppers.  Could this be?  Is this the real deal? I've learned to inspect and taste the food before I leave.  I'm happy to say that after one small bite I was blown away.  I took one bite and was back in Brooklyn at the So Good Chinese Carry out.  This is hands down the best Chinese food in town, so good that I drive 40 miles to chandler once a week to get a taste of NYC.    If your from the east coast and love NY style Chinese food, this is the place to get it.  NO WHERE  in the Valley can come close to this place, I want them to open more locations around the valley!|review|HSXU1bwPOPPkKTf4WKDggA|1|1|4

I went through the process of elimination... maybe it's the weather changes, maybe I messed up taking the pressure, etc.. finally I took my car to Discount Tire because I have always received excellent service at the other stores I have been to.   At the front they were nice but doing that thing that most car shops and dealers do where they don't really talk to you like you have a clue because apparently only men deserve to be taken seriously when discussing cars.  A little over half an hour later someone comes out and tells me there's no leaks but I need to pay more attention to my tires because the air was low.... no crap, that's why I thought there was a leak because tires just don't continually get low so you have to put air in every week unless something is wrong.  I tried to explain the problem again and the guy walked away while I was in the middle of my sentence.  I tried to ask about pricing tires and he was basically shooing me out of the door.  I guess he forgot he works in sales/customer service.   I will never go to this location again and would definitely not recommend it to anyone, especially not women unless you enjoy being talked down to by misogynistic males who need remedial lessons in how to provide actual customer service.|review|RCQLtEHDwgY01H1tQ6WVXw|1|1|0

Since it is the only Walmart near Central Phoenix, there are no alternatives. There have been days when I HAVE to get something from Walmart (I avoid it by all means believe me) and EVERY time I go in to the temple of doom, I come out more mentally damaged.  Let me start off by writing a list of why this Walmart is so AWFUL:  -The parking lot smells like pee and rotten meat. -The parking lot has the craziest cars in it with the most ridiculous car decals on them. For example: ""R.I.P ______""... only there are 7 different names on the car!!  -There are thugs in the parking lot who will stare at you! They are just standing there, watching people, it's like.. Really? -People ask you for money from left and right in the parking lot. It's like, I'm resorting to coming to Walmart, do you think I'm shelling out dollar bills? -When you enter the store- it is horrible.  -People fight at this Walmart! Couples cussing each other out accross the bread isle, dirty kids running around without being supervised by their parents (kidnap danger!), meth heads, weirdos, gross people, crazy people ect. One time I was in the dry fruit section and this guy threw a can of cashews at this girl while saying, ""Well then, f* you b*!"". No one did anything... -The lines are SUPER long and they have VERY few cashiers. No other Walmart is this bad. I am always in line over 20 minutes at this Walmart! -The employees are AWFUL. They will literally tell you they do not care. They are scary looking and often try to intimidate you. -People are selling CDs and magazine subscriptions INSIDE the Walmart! -People harass you for money INSIDE the Walmart and will call you a b* if you do not give them money (happened to me while I was buying scented candles) *tear* -Security literally ignores  you when you approach them about people harassing you at Walmart.  -The employees talk to each other about inappropriate things in front of everyone (even kids).  -Everything is dirty and disorganized. -Weirdos follow you around the store. -You literally feel that you will get mugged or raped while walking to your car, especially at night (scary feeling!).  So now, instead of dealing with all this trauma, I go around to my beloved Target on the other side of the shopping center. There is a security guard (sometimes 2) at the door. The shoppers are normal people. The parking lot is the complete opposite of the Walmart one. The store is clean and organized. The employees are normal and are actually nice to you.   Overall, BEWARE of this Walmart! If you find yourself here, RUN AWAY. FAST."|review|Mmew2rqnwj8FW3qD9wsaQQ|2|6|5
c0RSs2KYK5Y-ZlSrNq9LyA|2010-02-13|T3bMKfuLXPd8dI4B6EBz3w|3|I must confess, I didn't try to the sushi here, but I plan on going back another time to try it out.  But what I did try, the Curry Soup and the Potstickers were quite good.  I met a friend there for lunch, and it was quite busy, but we were able to snag a table without a wait.  There seemed to be some confusion as to who our waitress was, and we had like 3 different ones try to take our beverage order, but eventually they sorted it out.  The Curry Soup was divine!  Red curry, coconut, a bit of heat combined with the sweet crab and rice made this the perfect soup in my book!  The potstickers were nice and crispy, and the food came out pretty quickly.  My friend got a basic sushi roll (California) and said it was good too.  I do want to come back and try the sushi, especially the dessert sushi, which looked really yummy. The inside decor is modern, clean and comfortable, making for a nice dining atmosphere.  I would have given them 4 stars but they don't have a lunch menu, and it is kinda on the pricey side when considering lunch.  Most sushi places offer lunch bento boxes, but not Moto, and I really think they should jump on that bandwagon!|review|fAiVqZv7P_oc5CzGMX_G9w|1|1|1

I should have known better...My spidey senses was telling me to leave..but no, I stayed just because I've been craving, jonesing for Caribbean food. So I placed my order, I had Curry chicken, rice and peas and cabbage. I declined the plantains, it seemed the flies enjoyed it better than me. They were having a blast swarming over the plantains. I paid something like $10.95...which in my opinion was too much considering the proportions don't match the price. The taste was just ok...not the worst..but not the best either. The cabbage was pretty good though. The food seemed old too..if I had to bet $20..that food probably was cooked yesterday cause the kitchen did not look cooked in. I feel like a sucka reading these damn reviews thinking I was gonna get a good meal...I don't know where the hell these folks who left reviews ate at..it sure as hell doesn't seems like its this place. Maybe I came at the wrong time. My 1st time sucked....and my bubbling stomach thinks so too. 2 thumbs down and a wtf.|review|36EGeUpdSLBmfFd4zpjXGQ|0|4|2

That being said, I think that calling Mojo a ""yogurt"" place is a stretch. The ""yogurt"" had a more ""sorbet"" consistency because it was more icy than creamy. The flavors were pretty bland and some of them tasted very citrus-y, very similar to the flavors of Pinkberry. Yes, they do have the same self-serve options and toppings as Yogurt Land, but I wasn't impressed with the taste or the price my yogurt.   If you want frozen yogurt and happen to be in the Biltmore area, then I guess this would do the trick. Other than that, I wouldn't go back."|review|EOlGkRn-83UnF7634dOUKw|0|0|0

They have a solid HH menu with many options to choose from. My coworkers and I recently went for sushi and drinks. This visit left me feeling unimpressed and solidified my love for Kona Grill. The sushi was...OK. Nothing great this time around. The others in my party felt the same about their food. It took a good 15 minutes to get our check and another 15 to get our cards back after paying. Of course I was in a rush but even if I wasn't, that's a long time to wait to pay your server.

DE8UVNCCpOE0vTAbGaMoeQ|2011-08-15|Pe0V3IWauPEDdZy5Pt2Clw|5|Right from the first few seconds I opened the door to Romanelli's, I felt like I was in a fairy dreamland.  I was immediately greeted by a beautiful display case of Italian cookies, which we (my husband and I) later went back and bought a pound of.  Then we followed our noses to the deli counter, where they had both hot food already prepared, as well as a menu of deli sandwiches. We decided to shop around a little bit first, since I wanted to buy a few items. We took our time wandering around the store, and after about 10 minutes on of the owners, Robert, came over to us to make sure we were okay. He then proceeded to take us around the store pointing out all the best ingredients and what I was looking for.  It was a delight! I stocked up on the basics like EVOO, balsamic vinegar, pasta, and bought my first can of San Marzanos. It was after the canned tomato aisle that my heart stopped. I literally turned around and almost peed my pants. I almost pee my pants just thinking about it. I spotted the pastry case, and contained within was a HUGE eclair that made my heart do a little flutter. So of course I HAD to get an eclair....and a cannoli and baklava. This was my first cannoli and will most definitely not be my last. YUM!!!!!!!  We then went back to the deli counter and ordered lunch. I had the Italian Stallion and my husband had the sausage and pepper sub. He was so impressed, that we ordered 2 links of sausage to take home with us!   Overall, this being my first time in an Italian deli and grocery, it was more of an experience than anything. The people were so friendly and helpful to the blonde girl from Phoenix. I clearly didn't know what I was doing but they have so much passion for their food and what they do, that they took the time to help educate me on Italian cooking and all the pleasure it brings. Even though it takes about 20 minutes to get here from my house, I will definitely be going back.|review|vHoKL-4FCgGSfDrPr43Opw|1|0|2

Please someone build a breakfast place here that is smart enough to have free internet.  I can't believe I pay high prices for breakfast at a joint that is to cheap to deliver free internet to their clients.  I always have to sponge off Kinkos and thats painfully slow.  Its 2012 if you sell coffee and breakfast you better offer internet.  The display cases look great but most of the deserts that I have had taste a little stale.  The most impressive thing about this place is the photos of the owner rubbing elbows with all the Hollywood Elite.  Maybe thats why breakfast costs more than $10.00 somebody has to pay for all those expensive friends.  The employees are very nice the coffee selection limited and average tasting.  Bagel sandwiches are good.  I have been informed by employees who work there that they have failed many health inspections so I try to stick to coffee and bagel and avoid the eggs and meat.  All in all very average yet convenient.|review|QnMPMD8Nh3ErZGfMRGAeYg|1|1|1
lBRCMN7wNn-BKUsaOXJRow|2012-06-11|L4So40fqKjnhPdAgKVua_A|4|We buy all of our pet food here, which is a little pricey but it's the healthiest food out there (Blue Buffalo) and it would cost the same anywhere else. I believe that after your 9th bag you get the 10th one free, or something to that effect. I would rather support a smaller pet store than shop at PetSmart. We have also taken our dog here for the Self-Wash. If I had it my way, we would wash him here every time! Because it was our first time, the friendly staff upgraded us to the most premium wash for free, which included 3 different types of spray shampoos, a blow dry and doggy cologne. My dog absolutely hated the bath while it was in progress (he's a scaredy-cat and I think the spray jets and the blowdryer scared him), but afterwards he smelled so clean and felt so soft that I think he was happy and appreciative!|review|lOvgjEkecLfVJwJriEjt2w|0|0|0
Ec3FZiigDka9cV17b3wXdw|2012-11-24|MrT_2SdjkPyoMu3SSo4LdA|2|I think this is an awesome business model with poor management.    The location in downtown chandler is perfect for a place like this.  In-state wines and a restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere fit perfectly with the surrounding establishments.  That's probably the reason that this place survives.    Alas, everything else is dysfunctional:    The food is terrible.  Kitchen nightmares terrible.  There are way too many wine choices, some which are pretty gross.  A few are good, though, and those are the ones that they should promote.  Also, the good wines aren't good in the snooty, wine and food know-it-all sense.  They are a little gimmicky  and should be approached as such.  But they are still tasty.  I send a case of the white merlot to my family for the holidays every year and they really look forward to it.  Also, this is the only place that will ship the wine for me.  Not even Bevmo will.    Kokopelli has real potential.  Also, it's (apparently) the only winery in the state that has  significant market penetration outside of it's establishment i.e. you see a fair number of bottles at costco and bevmo.  However, it needs a shot in the arm.  Maybe Gordon Ramsey could help.|review|X-AOcuGqWACSwAusrjYIpQ|0|0|0

VY_tvNUCCXGXQeSvJl757Q|2012-01-19|fn_cDa0X5ntHlILiOSJELA|4|"We've been to the Mellow Mushroom in Tempe a few times now and really enjoyed it.  Tonight my wife was really craving something and some how stumbled on this one on our side of town.  She was sold, she had to have it tonight.    The Pizza at Mellow Mushroom is always fantastic, and this one was no exception.  We had the Thai Pizza.  It has some curried chicken, cucumbers, basil, tomato, some onion and a sweet chili sauce.  It was fantastic.  It was sweet and savory and a little spicey and just all around yummy.  The crust on the pizzas here are always great.  They aren't the super crunchy crust like at  New York style pizza.  They are a little soft, a little chewy and a little crunchy.  All the goodness is there.  We've had several of the Pizza from here and they are always awesome.  We also got a Steak House Salad to split with the pizza and again, it was great.  We substituted some Parmesan cheese for the Blue cheese (I just don't like it) and it was superb.  It was your typical salad with mixed greens and the usual chopped veggies.  But they also added in some corn ""salsa"" and some avocados.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was super tender and delicious.       The beer selection here is also great.  They have a bunch of local brews (some are seasonal and some are always there).  Our waiter was pretty knowledgeable about the beers (although we've had some that aren't always so knowledgeable) and brought us out a few samples of the ones we were interested in.  The only real reason that I'm not giving this place the 5 stars that it may deserve is the price.  It is a little pricey.  The beers are 6 bucks a pint, the small pizza we got was $12 and the salad was about the same.  So all in all, for the two of us to have a slice of pizza (with 2 left over) and some yummy salad was $50.  If you are willing to spend a couple extra bucks for something fantastic this place is definitely worth it."|review|ApRRz7fmtLKsfFU6963OUw|0|0|0

I live in Oregon where spirits are only sold in state run stores.  Part of my vacation is being able to experience Total Wine. The wines are only part of the experience but it is an important part. There is a selection of high end wines that interests me a lot but there are many drinkable wines available for less than $10. The whiskey selection is outstanding. The vodka selection is amazing too. The beer selection doesn't Interest me but seeing the variety should interest those who prefer the beverage. I usually buy bottled water too. There are some interesting ones and the price is usually less than the supermarket price for high end products. I enjoyed stopping at a store in West Orange, NJ one time. My brother-in-law called us when a store opened in Vancouver, WA because he had never before seen anything like this before Washington ended the state monopoly.

VfYgB0LE44-qdCDpneXq2g|2012-07-10|szXc2TUbGeh5lkzWZ9KQYw|1|Here's the question you have to ask yourself: how much trouble are you willing to go through for a good (not great) product? The quality of service is really spotty: sometimes good (again, not great) and sometimes horrendous. I dealt with the team in the Chandler Mall for our wedding and no one seemed to know what was going on at any given time. One of my groomsmen was given the wrong suit (similar color, but not the same suit), even though we ordered and paid 3+ months in advance. They're unwilling to fix their mistakes, difficult to get a hold of over the phone and again, all for only decent quality. Furthermore, I disagree with the other reviewer: as far as men's suits go, they're not very knowledgeable about current trends and actually try to push you in the direction of their personal style (in our case, a middle-aged man who probably has pants 4 sizes bigger than our largest groomsman) instead of listening to what you actually want.   If you are willing to put in the time to call a million times and still possibly end up with the wrong stuff, I urge you to test your patience and go with Nick's. If you want things to go smoothly, I recommend you consider other options.|review|NpjPqm3Lp0uEcAdodTsQcQ|1|0|2

I had a bloody mary that was not very flavorful, and some calamari that was also very bland. But, it was an OK experience, and the service was friendly, so we decided to go back for lunch. This time, we sat inside. The walls are lined with TVs showing stats on all the horse races. I think we were the only ones here NOT betting on the races. It was OK, just a little weird and it felt like a really lonely dark dungeon. I had the shrimp scampi for lunch and it was actually delicious! Their Armadillo Ale isn't bad either. I also like that they have daily specials on food and drinks.  I would come here again but probably not during the afternoon since the atmosphere is kind of depressing, but for a few evening drinks, the Armadillo grill is a good choice.|review|fdfax5deZnM-pmeiyhIJVw|1|1|1

She actually wanted to go to the Melting Pot since that was where we had our first date at - but hey, I'm the man here right? And I say that we are trying something new!  Entering the door and going through the kitchen is different... and weird. If I hadn't read about it here on Yelp then I would have thought I walked in the wrong door. The girlfriend swore I was lying and we actually did come in the wrong way. Even after seeing people come and go through the kitchen, she was still skeptical! LOL. It is a nice touch though - my comment was ""it makes it a bit harder to spit in your food with cusomers walking through all the time, huh?""  I know, the way I think of things is weird.  The garlic bread was good. I generally don't like a bunch of ""crap"" on my bread but I actually really enjoyed this break. I could have made a whole meal out of it (I've heard that from others).  The taters were good as was the steak. The searing+flavoring was phenominal on both her Filet Mignon and my New York. It was probably one of the better flavorings I've had on a steak to be honest.  I actually undervalued the bill too. I figured I'd be hit with a Delmonico's (Vegas) tab but it wasn't so bad. Service was good too - I drink a lot and my water glass was never empty.

When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change, receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible, too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him. Right.   I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it.  The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, he's the owner and CEO of the company. I highly doubt that.|review|7wPcbtQeZ0ZXdpe_oBYP6Q|1|2|1

Luckily, I long ago adopted the method of ordering Mexican food that went:  I don't know what that is. Let me have one of those, please!  So happy that I adopted that method!  Also so happy that I found Huachinanga, it is by far the best Mexican food that I've experienced in the valley. GO!  They are also one of the only places that has Habanero Salsa that is hot, but does not make you want to spit out your food.

And you have to love the $0.01 margarita just for checking in! If you are a fan of Carne Adobada, you will absolutely love the way Padre's does theirs. Flavorful, hearty, but not so spicy you can't enjoy the depth of the flavors. The Tequilla Shrimp was awesome and if you really want something different, the West Coast Burrito is very tasty. Our server was great, attentive and checked back with us often enough to make sure everything was OK, but didn't hover.

But, it was just beans and cheese.  Nothing fancy.  I won't rave over it. The chips and salsa were OK.  I would have liked more salsa, but since you have to pay extra to get them in the first place, I didn't want to get charged more. The highlight of dinner?  The horchata!

A cautionary note for the iPhone-less masses, Google Maps led us astray while heading here on Scottsdale Road, so familiarity with the area, or at least a map thereof, is a prerequisite to an on-time arrival.  After finding parking far more quickly than the actual restaurant, we entered and were seated in a side room with what can be best termed a western-themed mural with some cowboy representations away from the action of the main room and bar. This was clearly a selective preference that went over well with my parents, but judging by the plural number of people asking to be reseated in the bar area, it is definitely not universal. Otherwise, Cowboy Ciao is relatively minimalist and focuses on the food:  - Pork belly ($12): Pass. Unremarkable. - Panko-crusted Halibut ($29): Pass. Disappointingly bland and dry.  - Peanut butter brownie ($10): A stealth cheesecake full of flavor, but the requested substitute of five spice ice cream over the banana bourbon was definitely the highlight.  For perhaps the first time in recorded history, my parents made far better ordering decisions than I did, samples of which made me realize my shameful error:  - (Mini) Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry ($14): Signature dish for a reason. I could easily leave the polenta, but the varieties of mushrooms themselves in the complementing sauce I'd only like to leave in my stomach. - Pork shank (~$28): Soft, juicy, and very well-matched with the cranberry walnut sauce more appropriately called a curry than a chutney.  - Short ribs (~$28): The meat itself was solidly tender, but the real attraction was the dried cherry barbecue sauce, so much so that I wished I could have eschewed the high-end proteins and just gotten it with a plate of sliced pork.  Based on our experience and having heard what I did about the ""Stetson chopped"" I would certainly return for a visit where I hopefully will choose more wisely, lest I further disappoint myself and any dependent companions."|review|g0QWJpYSfWKxQiel7gbFuw|5|6|5

I usually don't like chain restaurants, and if you are eating here, it is probably because you are in a hurry, and choices are limited.  It isn't really ""real"" food, but sometimes you've just got to do what you've got to do.  Not a place I would eat daily or even weekly,  but there are a few things I like here:  1.  The iced tea is great.  2.  Their chili paste (comes in a little packet on the side) is quite good, actually a bit spicy, and can make their uninteresting fare flavorful.  3.  Entree:  The Sweet Fire Chicken with the above mentioned chili paste added is a fairly good fast food meal. It is basically breaded, fried, and candied chicken breast meat, so take it for what you will.  4.  If you get vegetables rather than the noodles or rice, it really starts to resemble something quasi healthy, which it still isn't, but  do what ya gotta do to get through the day."|review|OJ4FQEvd2h8QXCMHwCostg|1|1|1

EmlgWjs1ZzZEpDjZCSPLmw|2013-11-06|AIWb1SVug43_maVWuGb_ww|3|"Last weekend, I went here to see 12 Years A Slave. Figured I might as well be comfortable in a reclining chair while watching a movie that was going to make me feel quite the opposite.  PROS: -This movie theater is really nice, which isn't surprising considering the area. -Assigned seating. No having to get to a movie theater ultra early and risk breaking your neck in the front trying to see the screen.  -Comfy chairs that recline. It's like being in your own living room! -It's totally okay to drink here, there's a full bar! -Because there's a full bar, it's 21 and over! No screaming children..unless you're just a screaming adult. In that case, stay at home and watch a movie.   CONS: -Because it is really nice, tickets are a little pricey. -The upper levels, where I sat, have a railing that is too high. It renders the reclining chair pointless because I had to sit straight up and still struggled to see the entire screen. I mean.. I know I'm like 5'4"" but c'mon!  -Although there's a full bar, it's expensive and makes sneaking booze in more appealing here than a normal movie theater where you can't drink. -A bowl of popcorn (yes..a bowl, not a bag) is about $8 and only comes in one size.   Overall, it was an enjoyable experience despite the cons. It definitely would not be my go-to movie theater, only if it was a movie I was really excited to see.   I can imagine this would be a great first date place, especially if you're the type of person who worries about having nothing to talk about during dinner. No talking required if you're eating dinner in a quiet movie theater! And talk about efficient-if the date's bad it'll be over by the closing credits."|review|Y7KS04okqSFAbg1NyImHkQ|1|3|3

Being that we were there on a Sunday, we took part in their special of half-off bottles of Arizona wine. (which occurs every Sunday)  I was able to taste small portions of several entrees and each was impeccable and thoughtfully constructed. The presentation was beautiful. For dessert, I branched out and tried the owner's recommendation of the chocolate-covered bacon peanut butter s'mores with homemade marshmallows. It was absolutely divine.   I would highly recommend this establishment on every level and from every angle: the service, taste, decor, and the list goes on.|review|2ejPSikL73mYUtD19nK8yg|2|0|2

I just ate the left overs from last night, because I couldn't manage to finish my plate after having one of the ""Casa Margaritas"" and enough chips to put me in a certain food coma... The left overs were just as good this morning as they were last night! DUH.   This place has the best everything in town. No joke.   Do yourself a favor, if you like spinach, get the Spinach Enchiladas dinner.   And don't leave without trying the house margarita. On the rocks. With salt.

My husband and I could not find what we were looking for, and the menu was no where near what you would expect from a sushi restaurant , very limited selection with the rolls. And I would have expected better food than what we paid for.  One other thing the hostess greeted us and told us that it would be a 15 min. wait to be seated in the restaurant, and that we should grab a drink at the bar.  As soon as we walked over to the bar I see a group leave some table, and tell my husband lets go there and sit and wait.  While waiting the waitress Victoria comes up and says that we could order dinner here too.  So that it what we did which was fine.  The only things is the hostess never came back to check up on us to see where we were.  I really think that's poor hostessing skills.|review|rSbqoimVUWPEbNSGwyjI-Q|0|0|2

One of my favorite times of the weekend is 11pm because that's when Whataburger starts serving breakfast tacos. (nom, nom, nom)  11p to 11a is the best time to go to Whataburger. They still serve the regular menu, but who doesn't have an unhealthy obsession with breakfast tacos? (Or is that just me?)  For the most part, I would rather be at Whataburger some time between 11p and 11m and eat my delicious biscuits and tacos and drink my Simply Orange than go to any other fast food joint.  I guess I'm a little biased when it comes to the whole In-N-Out v. Whataburger thing. I'm from Texas. I've been to the original Whataburger in Corpus, there's a Whataburger not two minutes from my dad's house, and the tiny town that my mother lives in has five (count'em five) Whataburgers for 75,000 people. I am a big fan of Whataburger.  I do have to agree with other Yelpers that the fries are weak sauce here. I'm actually a little disappointed. These aren't the Whataburger fries I am used to. Don't get me wrong, I like them and I think they are better than In-N-Out's fries, but they just aren't the same.|review|eAgcqq8MAe1ztS4gqDbpTA|1|1|1

Their bra selection is very limited to sizes most women don't wear such as 38FF! If you need a dress for New Year's or prom this would be a great place for a steal.

ppdupQ9MnvVtDTWWW59NKg|2011-07-10|L1Ft8uaftmO7UWIcqXMXDA|3|The talent that Stand Up Live has been able to book has been great.  The facility however could use some tweeking.  The entry way and exit area are a bit disorganized, difficult to get in and out of during the seating time between shows.  Inside, there really isn't a bad seat in the house due to the way the seats are staggared.  I would be happier if the menu were a little more sophisticated, standard wings and burger type fare.  Tickets are typically $25.00 a person which I think is really fair.  What isn't fair, is the two drink minimum.  Beers are 5-6 dollars, sodas are 4 and mixed drinks about 10-12 dollars.  Typicallly prices, but I'm not a fan of being told I have to order without a choice.  The servers scramble to get you drink orders and they do a pretty good job without interrupting the flow of the comedians.  I'm sure I'll be back before long.  I'm really hoping that this venue helps push downtown into the busy center is has the potential to be.

I didn't expect it to offer more things than Sprouts (they recently merged) and, frankly, always thought Sprouts was the better of the two but I've changed that opinion.   I stopped in today and found vast rows of shelves of everything my local Chandler Sprouts carries *and then some*.  I kid you not, I found a lot of products that I've always *wished* my local sprouts would carry consistently (ie. local lamb, more Rosie's Organic Chicken options, and more Applegate product varieties) *and then some*.  Seriously worth a visit!  I parused their meat aisle (they have lots of beef livers and turkey giblets) and their veggie asiles (they have a LOT of herbs and they're way cheaper than I've seen at other groceries) and I'm sure hoping that now that Sprouts/Sunflower has merged, they will carry a lot of Sunflowers buying power to my little local store because I hate having to go all the way to WFoods sometimes just to pick up a few things.  Way to go Sunflower!  Too bad you're not in my neighborhood.|review|A99dyhEqcd_yXKPfBWeZHA|0|0|1

They were more than accommodating, the whipped up the best omelet + a heavenly biscuit. I was transported home to mom making something special knowing I had a bad day at school.  At night, I love the trout, and I'm not a fish person, but its one of my favorites along with the martini's (always creative and fun)! The food lacks inspiration? NOT!

They have great coupons sometimes in the local clipper things or even on their site (which I just updated the yelp listing to include).   Karts here are good, but there always seems to be one or two dogs in the group so hope you don't get stuck with one of those.  You'll get about 13-15 laps after 3 hotlaps to qualify.  They'll line you up in a grid format for a flag drop and off you go.  Cool because only faster riders are in front of you... until you start to lap ppl :)  Great for groups... partys... etc.  After each race they have print outs of each lap and everybody's time so you can see where you screwed up and on what lap or know who to blame for you +3 sec lap time because they kept getting in your way ;)  Here are the discounts:  http://www.speedwayraceway.com/discounts.htm|review|8CNEh7fSbLwDuAKhLjDPKQ|3|1|4

Made with provolone cheese, these burritos have a more mellow and sophisticated taste than the average breakfast burrito you'll find drowned in yellow cheese.  You can get a Big Ass Burrito, or a Half Ass Burrito. Personally, I don't like to do anything ""half-assed"", so I opt for the Big Ass Burrito that, although adds circumference to MY big ass, is soooo worth it in the morning when you want a laid back spot to enjoy your meal and coffee (go for the iced).

I had heard great things about the place and the reviews were great for it, so I expected to finally have some good barbeque.  I lived in Austin last year and experienced great barbeque on every corner of the city practically, so perhaps I'm spoiled, but Joe's was really disappointing given the stellar ratings everyone gives it...  I had the two meat plate with brisket and chicken breast, two sides of cheesey potatoes and mac and cheese (I felt like eating some cheese I guess).  The brisket was absolutely horrible... chewy, dry, pink in places and overcooked in others.  I ate about a bite of it and gave up.  The chicken had good flavor and was pretty tender, this is what I mostly ate...  The mac and cheese was horrible!  I can't believe this because so many reviews said it was great.  Some people that came to the lunch who had eaten here before said it was a little off, but I don't see how this could possibly be good.  It had something on top of it that tasted like smashed up cheetos or the cheese packet from a box of Kraft mac and cheese, without any kind of liquid added to it.  The cheesey potatoes lacked any sort of cheese.  They were bland... I ate a little of it but mostly skipped that too.  So for $12 I ate most of the chicken and avoided everything else.  Also, they wouldn't give us the birthday $10 off thing because we were lunching the day before my birthday.  I understand there's no exceptions and we didn't care a whole lot...except that we had 12 people there who all spent about $12-15 each with meal and drink... it would have been a nice gesture for Joe's to knock off my meal since we came all the way from out of town and there would have been no way for me to actually dine there on my birthday.  I won't be going back here, but I might try their other location, the Farm one... it could be good if we're not there after a lunch rush or something.  It seemed like everything that was served to us was sitting for quite a while besides my chicken.  For the price, definitely not worth it.|review|Ts367xA-JqA4s13qY0awbg|0|0|0

At VT, they also make a decent prime rib, some very serviceable burgers, a crab cake sandwich that really uses real crab and tastes like a crab cake should (no, it won't transport you to Newport News, but it's good:), and a Chinese Chicken Salad that always seems to draw me in:)  I've had all of these menu items before (and several other items as well) and never had a bad meal:)  In other words...good, solid tavern/road house fare...except for the chips:)  They transcend the genre and make VT a place worth returning to from time to time (not too often...got to watch the cholesterol:)  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service has always been very pleasant and friendly:)  I never feel that the staff is trying to ""optimize"" me or turn the table quickly.

I only got soup from here (had my stupid tooth pulled the day before), so I can't really make an honest review.  So this is just a few feelings and vibes I got from the place.  I was shocked into wide-eyedness upon opening the doors to this place.  I thought it was just a little deli.  Remember folks, I'm new to Phoenix so I don't know stuff.  But this place is HUGE!!!  And BUSY!!!  And...HUGE!!!  When my eyes finally registered what was in front of me, I was like ""Wow, really?!  A cafeteria line?!  Sweet!""  I literally stumbled a bit out of surprise.  A wrap around line on one side, and then another around the corner.  I think there was like a drink station on the other side.    I thought this was going to take a while, but NO WAY!  That line moved faster than a line for free stimulus checks signed by Obama himself.  The guys behind the glass know what the heck they are doing.  You get the feeling these guys went to school somewhere for sandwich making.  (I actually just Googled 'universities with sandwich names' so I could insert a joke here...to no avail) The swiftness with which these guys and gals slapped those sandwiches together made me smile and look on like a kid.  It was exciting.  It was fun.  No joke.  The soup was only like 3 bucks, but the sandwiches and entrees got a little expensive.  You'll get outta there about $10 lighter.  For lunch just for one day, that's a bit much for me.  But MANOHMAN!!!  The meat looked so juicy and tender and scrumptious...I wanted to hold everyone up at gun point so I could make away with all the meat.    The price is high, but the sandwiches that I saw moving along that slider were stacked just as high.  You'll get your money's worth.  A place is doing something right when they make you want to come back asap.  I mean like tomorrow.  I hope the food is as good as it looks, or as good as the herds of people spilling in and out of there suggest it is..."|review|KI4sBf9jWLs4aGm_mIsFQA|1|0|0

A cross between neighborhood cafe and bed & breakfast, Arcadia serves up an excellent breakfast. I kept it simple with a tasty Almond Croissant to tide me over right away and followed it up with the two eggs any style (scrambled) with breakfast potatoes and bacon. Oh the bacon. Perhaps the best tasting bacon I've ever had. Yes it was that good! You know a place is 5 stars when they can get simple classic dishes to taste great. How great? I normally slather on some ketchup or sour cream on my potatoes and eggs but wouldn't have even thought about it here everything was so well done and flavorful.

I hope they keep their end of the bargin since I was told 3x I will not be charged for x-rays that I dont get a bill and actually get chrged.

QCosRCJ1owLMgaHnXOMqQQ|2013-07-20|X5NsFFTlh0sXuL5pkQgUmw|1|I've been trying to figure out the best grocery store to go to in my area, so I have been looking at the weekly store ads I receive in the mail to compare prices. Fresh & Easy seemed to have the best deals on things I needed this week, so I decided to go there for the first time.   I was so disappointed when I realized that the $.48 avocados were really in a pack of four, for a total of $2, which is still a good deal, except that all of the avocados in the bundle were tiny and bright green (not ripe). Their individual avocados, which were mostly way too mushy, but a couple were ripe, were nearly $2!!! Unbelievable.  Similar to a review I read below, I couldn't buy an individual onion; they were only available in packs of four. I don't eat enough onion to get more than one. Plus, as with the avocados, the pack of onions looked like they were not ripe. I agree with other reviews below...some of the prices in the store were really great deals and others were just ridiculously expensive!  The worst of it all...I bought a bag of oranges. This morning I peeled one and began eating it and found little bits of black things throughout the entire orange. A pretty good amount. I found a bigger black piece to examine and it was hard like a metal. I was able to break it in half and the inside looked metallic?! I have no idea. But the orange was sour and, obviously, after finding black metallic pieces throughout it, I threw the oranges out. Awful experience. I will not be returning.|review|mV3Kpc28tFpdyo15o9rTQw|0|1|0

My little sister recently tried La Grande Orange Pizzeria due to another hot spot being full. When in town my sister recommended popping in with my mom for a quick bite. I was very impressed! We waited for about 10 minutes for a table, which went by fairly quickly since we browsed in the shop next store.  We debated on buying a bottle of wine to share for our meal (which is such a great deal since they don't charge a corking fee). We decided on margaritas instead. We ordered the pitcher, which is $25, but if you divide by the amount of drinks you get, it's a steal! We had the shrimp ceviche, which was amazing! We decided on a custom made pizza with all the fixing! The pizza had the best crust I've ever had in my life! Overall, the experience was awesome.

Honestly, we have yet to order a bottle of wine or even peruse the wine list :l   One of the reasons this place brings us back so often is the oh-so-delicious bruschetta! Just your most common bruschetta: bread, cherry tomato, basil, mozzarella version is so scrumptious! Quality moz and flavor packed toms kick this dish way up with the best of the best.  To go with my meal, I order the Moscow Mule. Boy oh boy do these guys make a kick butt MM! It comes in an authentic copper mug- nice touch.   For the main, I have only had the Chicken Picatta (Pan seared, green beans, egg noodles, lemon-caper butter sauce). I sub the egg noodles for bowtie. Truthfully, the 1st time was the best ever and the other times after haven't reached the yumminess I first encountered. So now I can say I'm ready to try other dishes on the menu.   Until summer hit we were seated on the patio, but lately we've been seated inside. Being dog lovers I really dig the colorful, artistic dog portraits, particularly the Last Supper rendition.

As far as burger places go, it's a good one, and I prefer it to Five Guys (somehow I leave FG paying the same). The bottomless fries are good too.  But take-out service is always slow (they quote 15 minutes and it takes 30). Dine-in service is almost always only average, and the first impression when entering the restaurant is never positive. We are a young couple without kids so they always ""encourage"" us, in a very pushy manner, to enjoy the open seating in the bar area. Without exaggeration, the pitch that we have come to expect is 5 or 6 sentences, which feels like an eternity. And it's rarely busy and we never have to wait. We do not like bar dining, which is why we go to restaurants, and when we always politely decline the hostesses do seat us as we request."|review|9ryWdjTHVqqAoETSazV3sQ|0|0|1

I absolutely loved it with their unique ambiance and their food truck kitchen and their creative yummy drinks. But my recent visit in a hot and humid summer afternoon changed that completely. It's a warehouse turned into restaurant, so there's no a/c in there. In Duce's defense, weather was bad. But that wasn't the only problem. I was at the bar for a good 10 mins. I didn't even get a ""I'll get you in a minute"" from the bar tender. I decided to be a teetotaler (for the day, of course!) and moved to the food counter. The line was bog which is ok. I ordered a scramble. ETA - one and half hours!! It actually took more like 2 hours. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS!! I had ordered avocados in my scramble. I got none of it, nor an apology or even a mere mention. Bottom line - the restaurant looks cool and unique. But all that becomes irrelevant when it fails in the primary objective of an eatery which is to provide food and drinks to its patrons. This is also in a not-so-great neighborhood.

I had the pleasure of trying out their Hummus Platter (I usually order the Hummus Sand-which, but it's such a large portion I can never finish it!) and I was instantly in love with Paisley's again! Their hummus was so delicious, full of flavor but not overwhelming, that I had to thank our server for her wonderful service and the amazing food. My only complaint would be that they do not offer wheat pitas (though they can substitute for multi grain bread, focaccia, or sour-dough).  My sister always enjoys ordering their Tuna Slam Sand-which (excellent mix of albacore tuna, mayo and greens without the overly intense mayo flavor), and my husband tried their Panini Cubano. Both enjoyed their orders, and my husband raved about his panini.   I love Paisley's atmosphere, choice of music and unique decor. The service can be a bit slow, but you can't rush delicious food. The food is well priced and their meal portions are adequate. The best part of their menu is definitely the abundant number of vegetarian meal options!

A place like this should educate their servers.  brussel sprout salad (3/5) - dressing was seriously lacking flavor. would have been a 5/5 if the dressing was good.  prime rib (2/5) - large cut, very little flavor, except for the crust. the cut was too lean thus was not as tender or flavorful as it should have been ... we got two of these at the table, both were the same  desert (1/5) - pecan gelato was flavorless - red velvet cake was flavorless and/or had too little actual cake... 3x too much cream cheese filling.|review|KucBnMrhalzxnD9AWrxwYQ|0|0|1

The AAA guide sent us here; it did not disappoint. We had kind of a long wait, but we ordered drinks from the friendly bartender to pass the time. When we were finally seated, we promptly ordered the guac. It was fresh and delicious-the pomegranate seeds added a nice touch. I got the chicken enchiladas suizas, which were also great. Hubby got the grilled tacos; they were also fresh and tasty. I have no idea when I'll be in Phoenix again but if I ever am I'll go back!|review|_csMVWq7uZC4cUNqh5Ufng|0|0|1

Hmm a few synonyms for moist - Clammy, oozy, drippy, dank.  Thankfully Chick Fil A's chicken isnt  any of those.  If it was, we'd have a problem.  I guess I'll have to stick with moist.

Waiting for my food, I noticed there were multiple flies in the restaraunt which is not a good sign... Then I got my food. Now, I like a good BBQ sandwich and was looking forward to this!  BUT, the bun was wet on the bottom, and when I picked it up, the meat fell through. It was not wet with bbq sauce either. It was more like water, which was slightly disgusting. I tried to eat the meat with a fork- there was almost no BBQ sauce and NO flavor.   I threw it in the trash and left. I was very dissatisfied.|review|TESe3g-BJSdZ5H4KC7yr9g|0|0|0

He is bored because his wife wont retire so they can travel and have fun, but that is a different story.  I needed a excuse to stop at Uncle Sam's and that was it....   I walked in about 1pm and was seated promptly(big word)....    The nice young lady brought me a Diet Coke and a menu.  She returned two more times to refill my drink and then FINALLY asked me when the rest of my party were going to show up.  I told her that I was it....  She then was somewhat embarressed and offered to buy me a beer or something, so I excepted the free Diet Coke.    I really came to Uncle Sam's to have a Meatball Sub but this time and the first time ever I ordered a pizza.    I waited................. and then she brought out a personal pizza for me....O-M-G!!!!!!     Now I know why people love this place!   It was incredible!!!!!

On my last trip, it took, I kid you not, 30 minutes to get a server to come and take a drink order. There were approximately 50 customers in the place at the time, ie NOT busy at all. Two servers came and helped tables on either side of our group, but both completely ignored the table of thirsty people. Then, one came up with an order for another table, asked if it was for us (there was NOTHING on our table, not even water or silverware). When we told her it wasn't our order, she walked away with a puzzled look on her face. Didn't even bother to ask if we had been helped or wanted something. You're right, we could have walked up to the bar and asked for drinks, but at this point the service was so ridiculously bad that it was comical to watch it unfold naturally. The only reason they don't get 1 star is because they have bowls and water for dogs on the patio. At least they get to drink, even if you don't.  Gotta give them props for that.|review|7Ki1_Yo8LDIGyCGPQpgFMQ|0|2|0

yVQiGdxmnrkJDyQXv2maNA|2010-01-22|w4KZLNNhWMFIi6QsVXN5BQ|3|"Vietnamese food had never even crossed my mind before, so after someone mentioned Pho Thanh I was interested in trying it. I've been there six times as of now.   The first time I went to the Pho I didn't have time to eat my meal there so I got take out. I got the number 133, which is a charbroiled slab of beef with steamed rice and veggies (posted a pic of this). Although for me it was more like charbroiled fat and bone; it hardly had any beef at all. My friend ordered the same thing, but he actually got a slab of beef. Maybe I was just unlucky and got the bad part of the ""beef"".   On my second trip I got the number 42, which is vermicelli (cold noodles) that come with a pork shrimp sliced egg roll, sliced grilled pork patty, and veggies all in the same big bowl. The pork patty was very good; juicy and tender, the egg roll was good too, and the vermicelli was kind of bland by itself until I mixed it with the veggies which where hidden underneath it, and added a little salt.   On my third time there I got the number 12 beef noodle soup / pho tai. To me, the broth was just OK but nothing special. Thinking that the broth was just a fluke that day, I got the shrimp pho at a later visit and again I wasn't too crazy for the broth. But I've been to the nearby Da Vang and I loved the pho there. I've ordered it twice and both times it has been great...a little on the salty side, but still better than Pho Thanh's for my personal taste.   I've also ordered the number 123, which is beef and a salad, with either rice or bread. I chose mine with rice; it goes great with the beef. The salad was OK. The beef was very juicy and tender. I put some beef in the rice a little at a time. They bring out the beef cut in small cube bite size pieces on a metal plate still sizzling loud enough to get the attention of the other diners.   Also, I've ordered pork shrimp egg rolls as an appetizer, and a banh mi sandwich for take out my four times there. The egg rolls are great; they also come with a plate of veggies and fish sauce to dip the rolls in. I've tried all four sandwiches and my favorite is the number 75 grilled pork sandwich; the patty in this sandwich and the patty that comes with the number 42 are just so juicy and tender! (posted pics of the egg rolls and a sandwich, tho it's the cold cut sandwich)   Inspired by Da Vang's delicious beef stew / bo kho, I decided to try the beef stew with rice noodles here at Pho Thanh. It was a disappointment. The portion is only half of what Da Vang gives you, and the pieces of beef are not tender and are studded with chunks of fat, and there weren't many noddles to speak of, the opposite of Da Vang's. I ended up leaving all the pieces of beef because they had so much fat on them it was impossible to eat around it. It wasn't very filling In the end it wasn't a very good meal. If you want a generous amount of good beef stew I recommend trying it at Da Vang.   Da Vang may have the better beef stew, but Pho Thanh has the better bahn xeo crepe. At Da Vang it's really greasy, rock hard, burnt, and very little filling. Here at Pho Thanh it's perfect; not much grease, pliable, and a generous amount of bean sprout, shrimp, and pork filling.   Having been to both Pho Thanh and Da Vang, I personally prefer Da Vang. Like most Vietnamese places, the prices are great; about less than $10 for a meal, and you will get more than enough food. (Unless you order the beef stew at Pho Thanh lol)"|review|vIkrSv2Eo-PNryNfG7z2KQ|2|1|4

On Saturday night we had the Chicken Parm and Lasagna. Served hot and quick and we totally enjoyed the dinning experience. We walked out full and plopped down $32 for the meal.

For those that hate smoke there is a non smoking entrance in the back to the bar side but if you want to play pool or use the Men's room you still have to run the gauntlet of the smoking patio.  Speaking of the Men's room, I have seen worse but this one wasn't really kept up that well and it could use a mopping as my feet stuck to the floor by the urinal.   They had plenty of good choices for beer on tap.  I was intending on a burger but table quantities of other stuff arrived.  The nachos were ok.  I don't normally care for hot wings because they are, well, hot.  These were grilled and while they left a slight after burn for me were really quite good.  I also had an onion ring, a potato skin and a cheese stick.  Good solid bar food without being Wow.  Service bounced between really good and ""where did she go?"".  They were out of stuff like iced tea, some brownies and some of the beers.  As a table we were buying enough drinks that those that mixed in glasses of water were not questioned.  All in all a good solid neighborhood bar."|review|Ps1Db9zOatoF_76FZNO5CQ|9|6|8

The pig is indeed a wonderful, magical animal and Schreiner's Fine Sausage is a wonderful, magical place that offers the full range of porcine products.  This is a pork-lover's paradise!  My favorite is the homemade slab bacon because it doesn't taste as salty as bacon you can buy elsewhere.  They will also slice the bacon to your desired thickness.  What could be better?  I like my bacon sliced nice and thick (setting number 6) so that the pieces cook up lovely and crisp.  I top my homemade Curried Deviled Eggs with pieces of Schreiner's crispy bacon.  You can also buy the slab bacon if you have a recipe that calls for you to make your own lardons.  Schreiner's offers over 60 varieties of homemade sausages.  They feature everything from Bratwurst, Italian and Polish sausages to the hard-to-find items such as: Andouille and Tasso (Cajun); Linguisa (Portuguese); Bangers (English); Chorico (Spanish); Chorizo (Mexican); and Cheese Sausage.  They also have homemade lunch meats, hickory-smoked hams and more.  Don't overlook their wall of pickles and pantry items.

We both agreed that we would never wait 3 hours again for this place or any other restaurant for that master. It was just ridiculous. We ordered the Marguerita pizza & although we did agree that the crust was light & thin we again didn't think it was worth waiting 3 hours for.

The salsa's were good but so hot that you cannot keep eating them. You can have too much heat. Flautas were dry, have had better frozen from the grocery store.

I'm not sure if i even tasted garlic. Shrimp is not their specialty. Red Chili burrito did have a lot of sauce, better than the Adovada but not worth the $8.50.|review|FLUATEpfj5xDQEtUtbu1fg|0|1|0

_AvHni-xdRHmZ3XfYHwGkg|2013-03-14|H4CWS9D0QcIAeJWVW91Xaw|3|"My wife and I recently went to Posh and had the full tasting.  We had reservations and were seated as soon as we arrived.  Our waiter was helpful explaining the menu and the ""improvisational"" concept.    The courses were small, but when you're getting 10-12 ""tastes"" the portions were just right.  Overall the food was OK, but not what I would consider spectacular.  The experience was unique for sure, but the cost of the meal (~$500 w/tip and one wine pairing for my wife) was expensive.  The service could have been better for such a high end restaurant.  We were served by a number of different people throughout the meal so it was hard to tell who was in charge of our service.  We also did not receive new silverware with each course, which was not a big issue, but it would have been nice not having to lick my silverware clean after each selection."|review|0R1ZGa8inkUIBUJOCZWrZA|0|0|0
Pyu7o8W7I5l4h1-QhgGJBA|2010-05-31|XZZR2lwX9nxo1CaIHI3CiQ|3|"Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldn't decide on a unique concept so they decided to ""borrow"" from all of their competitors' styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations.  The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions: - Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both? - Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.) - Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted. - Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available.  The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple."|review|g0QWJpYSfWKxQiel7gbFuw|3|4|4

I have a rule when it comes to food establishments and this place does follow suite. Most often than not the little mom and pop shop hole in the wall. . (( and this place is what I consider a ""dive / hold in the wall"". . )) usually have really good food.   So here is my review. And I will have to break it down into categories.   ---------Environment:**** Here's the deal. If you enjoy tennis, chess, and polo. This ""aint"" your spot. If you are comfortable with wobbly tables, hard chairs the sound of beer bottles tossed into a trash can .  .then keep reading.   Harvey's Wineburger reminds me of Stag's Head bar. In case you don't remember that's the name of the place on Dukes of Hazard? Ok well the waitress was no where near the same looks as daisy but she had a mom and pop shop charm about her. Smiles and jokes were readily available. Chris T. and I were rather excited about possibly finding a new ""joint"" to hang out at and writing a good review. I ordered the Cheese Wineburger and Chris ordered the Super Cheese Wineburger. She mentioned something about the fries and onion rings because we would get more for cheaper or something. I didn't really hear but Chris said sure and that was good enough for me.    ---------The Wait: ---------**  As we walked in the door it we found a dark bar with a grill on the left. We sat our selves hoping someone would notice. There were a couple people in there that looked like regulars chatting away about something to the line cook and I think that is what our down fall was. The food was late and the waitress right off the bat apologized as she gave us our to-go bag as we requested after franticly watching the clock. She tossed in the drinks and fries for free because of the wait.  There was a long wait for the order. I believe it was the cool jibber-jabbin to the regulars that hung up the order.   ---------The Food: --------- *****  If it came only to the food I would give this review 5 stars. The burgers were stacked high like it was going for a photo-op.  I like my fries a little crispy and thought they were perfect. I'm not into soggy fries.   I have to make a comment on the other reviews. These are the ones about the lack of hygiene comments. This is referring to one night that they were extremely understaffed on a Friday night. I have to ask you if you ever worked in a restaurant.  I hate to tell you but that is more common than you think. Even when I worked in a 4 star restaurant at a resort. Ever watch Hells Kitchen.  .yeah. . Stick your finger in my food and see if the meat is done. . Thanks. .  I have to say I have not made a final thumb up or down. Next time I go there for lunch ""and I plan on going back"" I will call ahead and order. My only issue with this place was the wait for the food. The staff was friendly in a down home manner.  The food was really good, and my only issue was the wait.   ---------Over all score: --------- ****  look for another review at some point. I'm not firm on this. I will have to see if the time service issue is the same next time.   Until next time. . keep the groove and be cool.  ."|review|bX2M7ERjL7HUvHLSExyUmw|2|1|5

The Thai inspired uses only the freshest ingredients and the food is always served warm right out of the kitchen.  It is a relatively small restaurant, however it is able to accommodate larger groups as well as provide a intimate setting.  The satay is done perfectly with beef or chicken and a peanut sauce.  The fish cakes are also delicious and worth trying as an appetizer.  The restaurant offers a variety of curry dishes, all excellent.  My personal favorite is the Panang curry with flank steak.  The duck is also amazing.  Latitude 8 does have happy hour specials and lunch promotions.  It usually begins to fill up for dinner around 5:00 p.m., especially on Thursdays and into the weekend.

Wasn't wow'd but it was huge, and we cooked the leftovers with eggs and grits the next day (yeah Denny's style).  The green burro was better, chunky pork but I prefer Hatch green sauce for its smokiness which this didn't have.  The comp salsa and chips is tasty, and for fellow cilantro haters, the radar didn't go off!

The first time I took in a few items they came out pretty good, although my silk blouses had odd wrinkles in them. What's the point of spending the money on dry cleaning if you have to meticulously iron the awkward creases and wrinkles out of your nice clothes??  I recently I made the mistake of bringing in some really nice, brand new work clothes (we're talking $105 skirts, $75 blouses), and they freakin put SAFETY PINS not through inconspicuous seams of the garment, as they should (I know this because my very first job was at a dry cleaner--it was common sense to my then-15-year-old self); they stuck the pins wherever they could--including in the front of a blouse, and though the center of a cotton skirt's waistline.  Thanks for piercing my beautiful garments.   Thanks to Seville Cleaners, my wardrobe has been taken down a notch by my desire to have the most cost-effective (i.e. cheap) dry-cleaning. Not only do I waste time driving through the circus of Old Town, but I have to labor over re-pressing every item Seville has touched. It's true--you get what you pay for. At this price, don't expect much.|review|qZrArI2ohkYkQlELl13BKQ|0|0|1

Guess each location has some flexibility in the brew they serve.  But back to the packed and popular for a minute. It's really, really busy. It's really, really noisy. And the parking lot is really, really full. At least it was when our big group -- #evfn -- was there Friday night.  Our waitress did an admirable job of handling a group of our size, especially when you consider that some of us like to get up and move around. She handled it great!  If busy and loud places aren't your style, you're probably not going to appreciate going there on a Friday. But I don't mind that stuff, so none of that detracted from the score.

I loved you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag us back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells.   You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).  The Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable and awesome that I want to eat it constantly.  But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?    And what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.    Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, because we've eaten so damned much of it.   So that's how I know that this isn't so run-of-the-mill.  That's why I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.    You're totally still a cutie, even at your ripe old age.

Occasionally, a restaurant comes along that makes me want to run around and bang on the doors of all my friends' houses in Tempe and yell, ""WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?!"" On the other hand, considering my affinity for delicious well-kept secrets, I suppose I respect that there are places in my neighborhood that I have yet to discover-- and will leave me satisfied and wanting more at the same time!   OK, to reiterate, this is a hole-in-the-wall. That means you should have no expectations about things looking remotely nice. The first time I walked in, there was a smelly bum asleep on the waiting bench inside. He wasn't hurting anyone though! I thought it was strangely sweet for the staff to let him have a little nap out of the sun... I have simply gotten take out both times, which is quick and painless. Now, a birdie told me that the owners of this place are related to the owners of Restaurant Mexico--which is irrelevant to the food, but it's nice to know about the little connections around town! The talented and tasty apple doesn't fall far from the tree in that family.   So-- the FOOD. The chicken is marinated in baby kisses and rainbows before it is mesquite grilled, and I hear the onions are pickled in jalapeno juice and vinegar. Together, that makes these two items alone truly the most delightful combination that man has ever known. I definitely recommend extra onions. The beef is nothing to scoff at-- it's seasoned, thinly sliced and tender.  The beans are beans. The prices have gone up recently and the combo plate (chicken, beef, beans, onions, salsa and fresh tortillas) now costs $7.49, while additional 1/4 lb meat options are up to $3.99. I will definitely be a regular from here on out."|review|sWtIduPNp6MtUPrGnDcb8Q|1|0|0

We planned a surprise baby shower for several out of town guests (we were from out of town, too) and chose this location for group lodging.   The rooms are excellent for the price - the entire resort consists of 1-bedroom suites, either King or Queen plus a pull-out couch. Huge bathroom with Jacuzzi tub and separate shower, plenty of counter / mirror space, a full-size refrigerator, plus sink, dishes and utensils, and microwave. An outdoor seating area (which we didn't use, since we were here during monsoon season in Phoenix!).   Unlike many other hotels & resorts, Orange Tree doesn't charge you extra for kids staying in the room, so we truly paid $60 per night for the 4 of us. Free wireless internet.   We had an issue with mosquitoes in our room -- staff promptly handled it and also took something off the bill for the inconvenience. Customer service was top-notch.   Beds are all posturepedic (think ""memory foam"") and outrageously comfortable. Plus the bedroom closes off from the rest of the suite, so it stays nice and dark in there.   The pool is very nice - lots of covered seating, and it's shady and comfortable after about 5PM. Plenty of shallow area for smaller kids to play in.   My only complaint is that unless you wind up in building #1, you cannot park anywhere near your room -- so if you forget something in the car, it's a 7-minute walk each way (from building 8, where we were) to the parking lot. From the lobby to the rooms, you can request someone pick you up in a golf cart. But I suppose the resort is designed with golfers in mind, who generally don't mind walking, even in the heat. For me, I prefer not to sweat if I don't have to, so I didn't like having so far to go each time we had to take our little ones to the car."|review|SZx7TqKjcgxed-ovmAbSjQ|0|0|0

This used to be one of my wife's and my top 3 favorite restaurants. During the last several months we were noticing cost cutting measures being implemented, such as the olive oil jars being removed from the tables and only portioned out by the staff (I can't stand referring to them as servers, it feels degrading). But the food was always top notch. Then, suddenly, about 2 months ago the management was replaced because apparently the cost cutting measures weren't enough.   Now, this is a completely different experience. Honestly, if I had never eaten here before the food would be good if it was a $14 per person restaurant. But compared to what it used to be and the fact that if you order an appetizer it's at least $25 per person, ""never again"".   I'll start with the calamari appetizer. Once lightly breaded and perfectly tender, it is now over done, bland and artless. The previously chunky, mouth watering marinara dipping sauce was watered down and soupy. My personal favorite Ricardo sauce used to have loads of fresh sliced peppers and tang, now it tasted only of melted butter with a couple of diced veggies on top and left a film in my mouth.   My wife's salad tasted the same as always, but my sausage lentil soup was suddenly mealy and lacked the flavor I used to crave.   We ordered the sirloin marsala, and while the taste was similar, the sauce was thin and my steak was noticeably tougher. Also they only had one vegetable selection instead of two or three like always. If you didn't like broccoli that night you were out of luck.   In short, while decent if it was a cheap Italian dinner on the go, the recent cost-cutting changes to the menu render this $25 per person restaurant a no fly zone."|review|fH9-qBN3KNjBk189PSKMrg|1|0|2

Last night, no exception to this trend.  So after a tasty first-time visit to Pei Wei in the plaza kitty-corner to Yogurtology, we were off and running for a tasty treat.    The staff here is very friendly, always wear gloves when offering samples, and invariably have a no-sugar added yogurt offering.    I do like the option of the ""bottoming"" bits, but figure this sort of counters the concept of a lighter, yogurt treat.  There are plenty of fresh fruit options in their bar and the graham cracker topping is not ""weapons grade"" (aka so finely ground that you choke the minute you try to eat it as you subconsciously inhale it directly to the back of your throat! argh!)

1oFvqm7eSpJbVpxpPxueaA|2011-09-25|lumIzq5DCsW5b1ZIQqyc_w|2|Ohhhhhhh Bucca.....I had such HIGH expectations for you!   Having attended several large parties at Buca di Beppo I didn't hesitate to book my fiance's birthday party for him and 20 of his closest friends. I was impressed with the banquet manager, Anthony, who helped set up our menu and made suggestions regarding serving size and what to order. He was super helpful and accommodating, calling to offer various seating options and confirming our party in advance. If ONLY he had set the tone for out evening!!   The good: The food was good. Yes, it is a chain, and the food reflects that. But our caprese, fried cheese, stuffed mushrooms, etc, they were delicious. Everyone LOVED the chicken parm and the pasta was great....and the red wine sangria was fabu!   Attention to mistakes was great. Our server noticed we had been delivered a small app when I ordered a large when I didnt actually realized that......she comp'd the small and sent the large out.   The management was good. Yes, I got to meet management! Super duper....allow me to detail the BAD.   The room we were in was ODD. Imagine a long table placed in a room that was literally only 2 feet wider than the actual table on 3 sides. It was like the bat cave of dining rooms. All of the food had to be served from one end, which was kind of an issue with the gigantic hot bowls of steaming pasta. Add to the fact that part of the room doubled as the drink station/serving computers and it was a pretty busy place.   Speed. My sister arrived early to greet guests and had to hunt down a server to order her drink after waiting 20 minutes. Literally. Hunt. Down. I arrived with the birthday boy and ALSO waited 15 for drinks. Water, soft drinks etc all took empty glasses and special requests for refills. The wait between appetizers and dinner was tremendous (ly odd). They served our green beans 5 minutes after we finished our apps but then the meal came 20 minutes later. WTF?   Service. I already mentioned this a bit but if you're still reading you might care about the details. Our server was clearly overworked. I'm not sure how many other tables she had in the restaurant but when you're serving a table of 14-20 I would assume they would be minimal....not in this case apparently. People at the end of our table (GUESTS) ended up busing our dishes. A bus boy eventually showed up to help clear and literally took a plate away from a guest with the fork half way to her mouth. Yes.....SHE WAS STILL EATING!   Our waitress brought out dishes for the cake which I appreciated since I hadnt purchases Buca's B-day cake and sometimes restaurants get weird about that. She left for a few minutes and shortly thereafter one of my guests overheard her complaining about how horrible our table was!!!!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY??????? I pretty much lost my temper at that point and ended our meal prematurely. While waiting for management I overheard not one, but TWO other servers complain about their tables (as I mentioned we were seated in the drink station area.....so I guess they were breakin' it down in there).   Management was extremely apologetic and polite although he obviously had doubts about my complaints. I'm going to choose to believe his doubts were related to his staff having an 'off' night as they are usually totally awesome? And to be honest I was soooooo angry by this point I wasnt able to detail the majority of my issues. There were certainly moments of greatness (ie the appetizer issue) when they demonstrated an understanding of good service. They took care of a large percentage of our check (which I wasn't expecting) but I completely appreciated since I had set up a cash bar and in our rush to depart ended up being an 'open bar' on me :-(   I wouldn't recommend this Buca unless you knew the server or management and were ensured a good time. As a former server I understand the stress of waiting on large parties, but still expect the style of service afforded to smaller tables. I really did appreciate the effort management made to appease our complaints but simply wish we could have skipped the entire drama. And as I mentioned, the food was delicious!|review|eMYYxDX7E_KxYV-Y6BljIA|0|0|0

We got there around 815 and were seated around 9, so if youre being leisurely, its worth the wait.  The menu is small and concise, making it somewhat easy to decide; it all looks and sounds so good. But it's all pretty basic meals with a couple of daily specials. One of which I had; scrambled eggs, jalapenos, cheese, onions, and a shit ton of delicious, partnered with home-fries and a tortilla. The jalapenos were just right and so fresh! We also had tried some of the walnut, raisin bread toast; which was fantastic. My boyfriend had the waffle which was good but I could tell he could use another one ($8 for one waffle?). I don't eat swine too often but the bacon was heavenly; thick and peppered. One thing I do regret about the meal was I saw someone order some chocolate milk, definitely should've got some instead of coffee; what's the rush to wake up on a Sunday anyway?  When we came out, some people who had been waiting near us, were asking what we got and how it was. It seemed our leaving Matt's got everyone outside's mounths watering. Everyone lit up to hear our reviews, which I thought was pretty funny...So all-in-all it was good but nothing so amazing (which is what I've heard about this place).

I had the beef egg sandwich which was actually really good - it's pretty much a philly cheese steak sandwich with eggs on a smaller round bun. My complaint about this mainly about the worker who was behind the counter cooking. It was about 9:58am when I stepped up to order, I think at 10am they stop serving breakfast and he kept complaining to the order taker to stop taking breakfast order. The way he was whining and talking very loud not only held up the line but made the customers uncomfortable.  He kept saying ""she's the last one, she can order a sandwich but no potatoes"" the other lady working behind the counter said it was fine, I can order potatoes to go with my sandwich. The girl behind me wanted breakfast too and the cook guy kept saying that she definitely has to be the last one. I don't understand how breakfast could end so abruptly and I'm only allowed to order the sandwich and not the combo.  The guy was rude and he may have been getting off shift because when I looked up again it was someone else cooking.  It's unfortunate because inside an airport you only have so many options, I wish the airport has some sort of say with the business inside so that travelers can have a good experience as a whole."|review|6Xv2qGam6tAlGV7QjgpDXA|6|6|6

fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug|2011-10-24|9mx2E2TKSU869YQoc2b4yA|4|My family comes here once a year, every year, for my uncle and sister-in-law's birthday and we do the whole Sunday brunch thing.   I would have to say the best thing about the place, even though the food is really very good, is the ambiance. Its an experience that from the second you pull into the driveway at the Royal Palms Hotel begins to surround you and cut you off from the outside world. The hotel itself is modeled like a Spanish villa, and the restaurant maintains this theme with large round hardwood tables that could probably support the weight of an elephant, a huge fireplace, exposed beam ceiling, wrought iron fixtures and embellishments, and Spanish tile on the floors. Everything seems very calculated down to the smallest detail including silverware and water pitchers that look to be hand hammered.  The brunch thing is a little odd in how its constructed in that there is a buffet brunch which is more than enough to have as a meal, but there are also menu items which you can order in addition to the buffet. The odd thing is that everything is priced such that if you go for just the buffet, it costs more than if you were to get the buffet in combination with a meal, and in the end by ordering a meal you wind up paying a dollar or two more. Very strange. As such, it always seems worth it to me to get a menu item even if you're not that hungry and just have whatever you dont eat boxed up to take home and eat later.  The food is really very good. I cant really complain about anything, but I will just say that there are certain shortcuts that are taken that are noticeable. For example, on the buffet they have kinda a gourmet version of home fries with onions and peppers and whatnot in it. I ordered an egg white omelet that was advertised as having potatoes, onions and peppers in it, but didnt really think that what would come was literally egg whites with the buffet dish mixed in. I mean, the dish was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it probably would have been better if the potatoes onions and peppers had been prepared a little differently...a different cut or a different cooking method--something to mix it up a little.  The price isnt cheap, roughly 22-28 bucks per person for the buffet/menu item combo (21 for buffet only), but this is not the kind of thing you do every day. Its a special occasion kind of deal and I think that generally speaking its well worth it. The waitstaff is very attentive and they tend to be very unintrusive as well. I appreciate that especially when you're trying to have a special lunch out with the family.   Overall, I would say this is a fantastic place to go if you're looking for a romantic dinner or a classy brunch every so often. Its a good solid choice any time, every time...especially if you like home fries!|review|0mwGMnMvgvKd11do4u5J3Q|0|0|3

Went here with another family during our ""stay-cation"" at a nearby resort. It was HORRIBLE! First, you can't miss the smell as you walk up to the place. I realized this is because of the Texas Longhorn right in front. Nothing like the smell of excrement and urine right before dinner. Second, the NOISE! This is a country western themed steakhouse, so whatever, be warned. Third, the service was the worst. Since we had a party of 8, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to our bill. That's fine, I get it, but apparently our waitress felt she didn't have to work for it since it's mandatory. She was rude and not very helpful...at all. I never experienced ordering a $20 appetizer (the fried rattlesnake) and having it thrown on our table, she didn't even stop! I was also looking forward to finishing our biscuits and fry bread, but apparently there's a time limit. She took them away without even asking. Fourth, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the 16oz T-Bone and it was under seasoned and not very good. The green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy. At least try to hide the fact that it was over cooked and soaking in hot water before it was served. Fifth, when it came time to pay the bill, we were given the right check, but our credit card was charged for another party's dinner! Really???? We over-paid for a terrible experience! Finally, the General Manager wasn't very interested in our experience as paying customers, he said ""it happens"". SPEECHLESS! At least he was consistent with the rest of the night.

When every single person I met in four days (I'm guessing for me it was about 15 staff) is so friendly - genuinely - and helpful, you will feel pampered.    Not the phony ""you're not rich enough"" treatment you can get at some of the coastal resorts - you know them if you've been treated like that.   One day I had a facial from Marcella, who'd been trained in Hawaii and had worked the Doral in Florida.  I came out looking like and feeling like a new woman.  Another day I got a massage from a young woman who had the sweetest voice and most powerful arms.  That's the massage of my dreams and I floated out of there.  Then Margo did my hair.  She gave me five tips I've never heard in years of hair appointments.  I got raves on my coarse and difficult to manage hair.  I'm sure many of the staff have worked this place since it was built - about 25 years ago.  Talked with Lucy at the Spa - 22 years; Albert since he was 16 and he's 32.  The staff number about 1200 and everyone gets a full meal free when they work.  $70 million renovation in 2009 - the public areas are beautiful but not over the top. The eye candy is the landscape - 2 acres of dozens of varieties of cacti.  Palm trees, nine swimming pools, three world class golf courses.    Our room (on the company dime or should I say C notes) underwhelming.  All the comforts - robes, slippers, toiletries, etc but style wise - a bit too retro for me.  That alone is why I didn't give five stars.  But look out the window or step onto your private veranda - Camelback mountain is right there with beautiful landscaping all around.  The resort is huge, 250 acres, but there are golf carts and courteous drivers everywhere to whisk you wherever you need to go.  The first night the company hired 2 hot air balloons for rides in the evening - fabulous!  The food - whether it was a sit down dinner for 400 or soup and salad at Il Terrazzo - excellent.

I've driven by this place a zillion times, and figured I'd give it a try.  I went in and paid the $11.50 for a plate of food, and I really didn't like it all that much.  I built my own dish, but the meat looked really weird, and the bowls that you put it in were somewhat small.  The selection was meat, pork, chicken and fish. I went with the meat.  I topped it with a few veggies, some sauces, and the cook threw it on the grill. It came out fine, but the meat was just weird.  It was shaved, and was kinda tough.  Veggies and toppings were fresh, but limited.  More salad topping stuff then anything else.  Tomatos, cucumbers. carrots, celery....weird (but healthy) selection.  I was hoping for more variety there.  The staff here was friendly and helpful, I will give them that.  Place looks like it might have been an old fast food joint at one point?

The woman selling the liquor, Tara who gladly customized my personal cocktail. A beautiful gin made in a double boiler from 100-proof vodka distilled then marinade over dried juniper berries, lemon rinds, cardamom and aromatic spices, turning it to an amber color.

As a vegetarian, this really limits the menu items I can eat.    Veggie quesa is pretty much the only thing I can get.  It is fantastic so it is worth going just for that.  Actually, I'd probably even go just for the salsa bar.  But I wish I could explore other options too.|review|cxjTpWMPg7u5Bb9OPWqaFw|0|0|4

I live in a studio apartment where everything is included (except cable/internet) and it's about $630-640 depending on water usage, but in my year and a half has never been over 640. Even though they control the air and heat, it is based on weather trends and not a fixed date.  The staff is nice enough, I've never had to deal with them for any issues; I pick up packages and ask random questions when needed and they are professional and helpful. The maintenance guys are really nice and always checking up on me if they see me walking around the property. My A/C went out once in the summer and they were there in an hour or so. Fixed it up quick. And they're really nice when I call about my garbage disposal even though they've shown me where the switch is a few times haha.  Rent is reasonable, staff is nice and helpful, grounds are decent. They even put in a cute little dog park recently! I'd recommend living here to any friend or family member.|review|K3Eokg2K1toxzutzZLt1wg|0|0|0

But if Mojo and Gelato Spot were in a heavyweight championship of how to retain best customers, Mojo has won round one. Why? Simply because of the awesomest event that runs every week on a Tuesday of which I love and that is Twitter Tuesdays! On this day and as an avid Mojo twitter follower, I am rewarded *that's what I think* for my fan-ship and loyalty with a fun secret word of which I made aware of the day of, and upon learning the secret word, drive after work to the Mill Ave location and get myself some Mojo fro-yo goodness for half-off! Score!! =) =)   I just love that at this location there are 14 flavors available to sample, and mix and create the best combinations ever! Oh, and the many toppings and mix-ins make the experience enjoyable! Love getting myself a cup of lemon fro-yo with a tinge of strawberry fro-yo topped off with blueberries -delish- on and birthday cake with choc fro yo mixed in with almonds, peanuts, and choco pebbles... OMG! Yes... I love you Mojo... I am a fan!|review|ROr4DQ-gxlfUKmiDC-qSEQ|0|0|0

I had a painful end to a long week and decided to switch to something other than my usual vodka.  The Smashed Irishman lives up to it's name.  The honey makes it smooth and sweet, but I could feel it workin' it's magic on me.  I got it on the recommendation of our sever.  He was wonderful, although I got a little jealous when two girls sat down at our communal table and he gave them the same flirty treatment.  You know flattery gets you everywhere, don't deny it.    I decided to give the gnocchi a try since it is my absolute favorite thing in the world.  Well, Avanti's gnocchi is my absolute favorite and I wanted to do a little comparison.  Culinary does it with sausage and mushrooms.  It is delicious, although heavy.  The sausage made it salty, but in a good way.  I still must say that I love Avanti's version more and probably always will.  Nothing beats them, NOTHING.  Why am I so obsessed with their gnocchi?  I think they put some sort of drug in it.   Those two flirty girls next to me started with the grilled cheese sliders and again, my side of the table was jealous.  Actually, they ate a surprising amount of food so I got to see a lot of what Culinary Dropout had to offer.  Back to my side of the table, the butternut squash cannelloni was to die for (according to my friend, I did not taste it) and the fried chicken was better than KFC...  so, I guess everyone was at least satisfied.|review|rjlb-7-JcmM6fR64ZpyTug|9|7|9

I discovered it shortly after moving out here 2 1/2 years ago (shortly after they opened actually).  This has been nothing but the best ice cream shop I've ever been to.  Top notch.  The staff and the product.  The owners are nice as can be.  The staff is always great and eager to help out.  The product.  Spectacular.  They will let you try pretty much anything.  The ice cream is creamy and the taste is dead on.  The sorbet is made fresh daily and you can tell.....tasty, smooth...don't really know how to describe a sorbet that just seems perfect, but they have it.  Their freshly made waffle bowls, made daily, are tasty also.  Oh..and it gets better.  Their ""single scoop"" can be divided into 2 smaller scoops or 4 mini-scoops.  This place is the best.  We've gone through more than a few free cones using their punch cards.  They also make shakes, smoothies, and ice cream cakes.  They sell all their flavors by the pint or quart.  The lady and I will continue to be loyal customers."|review|NrMU4Qs8qqIZ536buLYQ8w|1|0|1

The bar gets 4 stars for the beer selection alone.   Food: not so good. Belgian pizza is actually good, other than the pizzas the food is BOGUS. The best food here is in liquid form (the beer). Eat before or after, but I would not try much other than the pizza. I swear the wings were out of a microwave....  If the food was as good as say, 4 Peaks, this would be a 5 star review. The beer alone is enough for this place to get 4 stars though....|review|3dPeTVuQatCgQeyJgkwKdA|0|0|1

As you step in, there are cups to the side of the wall that you can pick up (looks like there are only 2 cups sizes, unfortunately they aren't marked). There is a sign that explains you go to the station with the flavors that you want and serve yourself, then take it to go weigh and pay for it. I got the vanilla and got blueberries and rasberries.. I didn't want to go for the other flavors like mango or pop tart since I didn't want it to be overly sweet.   Decor is modern and clean, very simple and to the point.  They have a lot of extras to put on your yogurt, (nuts, chocolate, syrups, etc.)  kind of reminded me of Cold Stone ice cream toppings. It came out to a little over $2 for 5 oz. of yogurt. Not sure if that was good, but it was pretty tasty.|review|uNbB1uR4EBhmygUc3IfPAw|0|0|1

I was going to be in the Tempe area so I typed in ""dinner"" in the search box and this place showed up first with its 600+ reviews! And I'm so glad we came! They were pretty busy at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Walked in, sat ourselves, and a server showed up a couple minutes later to take our drink orders. I'd say they were a bit slow and not as attentive as I'd like but its more of a pub feel and they were pretty busy anyway. We ordered the Crispin hard ale to share and it was pretty tasty, not very sweet. I like how they have a large selection international beers (like King Fisher from India!) on their menu, its like you really are in an English pub!  Our group got the Porky, Rosemary chicken, Lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala pasties. We also ordered the broccoli and cauliflower bake and banana dessert. They were all good but I loved my lamb vindaloo, it was like actual lamb vindaloo that you would get at an Indian restaurant! Ironically the chicken tikka was my least favorite because it was too tomato-ey but it wasn't terrible. The yogurt sauce that came with complemented the pasty perfectly.   The broccoli cauliflower bake was delicious and cheesy, totally hit the spot on a cold night! The banoffe banana dessert was ok but I was disappointed that it was mostly whipped cream (unsweetened). The caramel, graham cracker crust and sliced bananas were still enough to carry on the dish.   Overall great food, fun casual atmosphere ( saw LOTS of people on dates here) and totally worth checking out if you're in Tempe!"|review|WESBNCIvswTWh-Ak2uGf4g|1|1|1
DcrM4hwDcU2G6vuh2cnaYQ|2011-03-11|AR7Pc4DJoktBcjymOAfsgw|1|"I've been to NOCA several times before last night and always had a great experience. But last night was just downright bad. I'm debating whether I will return or not.   The evening started with our waiter telling us his name and that he was really stressed out because he was handling 15 tables and he was overwhelmed. OK, good to know. In retrospect it was clearly a warning to get out while I could without spending any more time or money there. Next, the diners at the table next to us (an older couple who looked super benign) started to complain that they had been forgotten and hadn't seen their desert for more than 1/2 hour. Another warning that I ignored. I'll cut to the chase in terms of service: long, long waits between the three courses (we were there for the Sunday Supper). When food did arrive, it was sort of flung angrily in our general direction. I mentioned that I didn't like cotton candy and asked if we could skip it. Our waiter was clearly upset by this and said he would try to stop it, but couldn't guarantee we wouldn't get it. We got it. We didn't touch it. The water and bread guys were terrific (we ate a LOT of bread and drank a LOT of water while cooling our heels between courses), so we left a good tip in hopes that they would see some of it. At the end of the evening, the waiter mentioned something about having a drink as soon as he got off work.   Now to the food. Some was great. My husband's steak was cooked perfectly, and my fish was good. The problem was that they had run out of some items (you only get to pick from three set options for Sunday Supper) and had started to substitute items on the plates. So, I got no le puy lentils or carrots, but I did get cauliflower. Dessert was the worst--they ran out of gelato, so they just plunked down two dry profiteroles on a plate with some powdered sugar. The dessert screamed out for the moisture of the gelato or actually for any moisture at all.  At the end of the meal, I asked to talk to the owner. I told him that it seemed like they were really off their game that night, that we had eaten there several times before and had loved it, but that we expected a lot more than we got that night. His response? That the restaurant was ""market driven."" That might explain some of the substitutions, but if you run out of a key component of a dish, like gelato, I assume that you figure something else out. You don't just leave it off the plate and hope for the best.  And the ""market"" has nothing to do with the incredibly bad service. So we got no apology for the bad evening, just a lame excuse. And every diner at every table around us was complaining similarly to each other--at one point several of us started talking to each other about how bad things were, with many vowing to not return.  So, bad service + mediocre meal + lame excuse = disappointing evening. I'd like to say that I will give Noca another shot and just hope that it had one bad evening, but I just don't know."|review|MkT6e_gu0HH1dw-iwigUDg|1|1|1

lktu5JPDlQUG-7cV7gOzDQ|2011-11-30|9pGJIZJmzpmr7mUQ98Ly6w|3|I tried to go to this place once and had trouble finding it. It is a pretty small spot, very cozily tucked inside of the complex across from Wet Paint. If you are having trouble finding it, take note that they have a dangling, long wooden sign that says Cartel outside of their door. I went in with a mate and we each had a cuppa. She took an iced toddy and I had an iced mocha. Their beans are quite sapid; a bit piquant, while still being very smooth in flavour. Of course, we both sampled the other's drink, which helped give a slightly well-rounded review as opposed to just having one. I would go back for either or. If you like your drink to taste like coffee and not like some kind of milky smoothie, make sure to ask for an extra shot in your mocha. I don't mind either way.  I don't usually drink milk, but the only alternative milk they appeared to have was soy, and that adds a pretty strong flavour and consistency to an iced drink especially, so I avoided it.  As far as the place itself, it is much bigger than I expected, walking in to it. It has a pretty hip vibe, featuring a space-separator made completely of bicycle tires. There is a book for drawing in on the central-most coffee table that is full of, can you believe it, mostly not drawings, but bad notes. It would have been neater if it was genuinely full of drawings that seemed inspired, but you can't blame that on the staff, really.  It was bustling, full of a wide range of people, and it has a lot of mediocre-to-okay-to-occasionally-something art everywhere that may be off-putting if you have a really critical eye or may be attractive if you like the whimsy.  The parking lot was also completely full, so I parked across the street at the gas station. Don't park in front of the dry cleaner/laundromat- they tow.  I would like it a lot better if it was much more low-traffic, as far as people go.|review|HAV50pwRVkmu8ZHD0bbZHQ|0|0|0

Me and a friend went about 2 weeks ago, we arrived late about 9ish and decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was amazing, she was great, she went over the menu with us and even informed us it was reverse happy hour and suggested some of her own favorite dishes on the menu.  I decided to go with their hamburger with parmesan french fries, yum! Their food portions are well worth it, the hamburger was huge and I got a plate full of fries, also the cheese garlic bread as an appetizer was delicious, not to mention their ice tea was amazing (and I'm a big tea drinker). We stayed quite sometime and I witnessed some guests still coming in close to closing time and the staff still seated them and served them instead of turning them away, that's giving good customer service.  I plan to go back and with friends soon, The Strand rocks in my book! Thank you guys at The Strand for giving me and my tummy a good time! :)|review|ULrhskAjS_nFVeTUualWZQ|0|0|1

Arriving about 6 P.M. on a Tuesday evening, there were no customers in the store when I arrived.  Staff of at least four were on hand, laughing and socializing amiably, but one broke off instantly to ask how he could help, and did so immediately, accepting the DVR and looking up the account to check-in the returned equipment, with no more than a moment of surprised expression on seeing the cable TV services were terminated completely.  He gave me a receipt for the equipment and I was on my way, mission accomplished, in less than 5 minutes.    It's a bright, clean, appealing store front set up much like a Verizon or other cellular store where you walk in, sign in, and wait your turn. Not a single other customer entered the store in my few minutes, though two or three were approaching the door as I left. If today's single experience is evidence of the regular scheme of things - after 6 P.M. mid week would seem to be an opportune time of arrival.      The store sits in an out-parcel building in the shopping plaza on south side of Camelback, just west of 20th street, diagonally across from Best Buy. There's no store front on Camelback, so you will  have to enter the shopping center to find the store, which is diagonally across from Best Buy.  While I'm quite happy to be back to free TV, in general I have not been displeased with Cox service.  I'm still on Cox Internet, at least until I can find a less-expensive alternative that meets all my needs, and am happy to have stores such as these in the community as an additional convenience and resource.  In ' n ' out in less than 5 minutes, you're experence may vary, but it's hard not to be a fan of that."|review|ZvvxtxeTad9t3ZoxdNYe_g|1|0|1

I found Petite during last year's restaurant week and it has since become one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. With each dish you really get the feeling that a chef is designing a culinary experience and takes pride in the food they serve, not just trying to fit the French restaurant business model. The Foie Gras is phenomenal, as is every other dish I've had the pleasure of tasting.   My favorite part about Petite has to be staff meal. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights the chef cooks up two unique dishes as well as a cocktail at a discounted rate. It starts at 10pm and is a great way to either start or end your night.   Finally the staff is knowledgeable about the food and drinks their serving. It's nice to see staff who obviously take pride in the establishment they work at.

I have a lot of great memories here at the Roosevelt, met a lot of wonderful people and friends who have been a big part of my life whether it is just grabbing a beer at the bar or taking over the huge community table or chilling at the candle lit booth section.  A few months back, a couple of ladies and I decided to stop by the Roosevelt while in Phoenix. It had been a long day of bike riding and the bar wasn't very busy (a big plus if you have been here on First Fridays!) so was excited to have a drink after enjoying our meal at Cibo.  A lot of sofas and chairs didn't have enough space for 4 people to sit with each other (you know that phenomenon when you go the movie theater and every row has seats but it would take an act of God to convince everyone to move a couple for everyone to sit together?) so we went for the high table in the middle dining room. It was missing a chair (and I have had the ""bitch seat"" in the past where I end up standing) but I was really tired after more than 20 miles of hard core bicycling and a relaxing carb-filled dinner. I went to take a seat from the bar but the waitress said we couldn't do that. I was taken aback since the bar wasn't busy and our table was missing the 4th chair.  She stated simply it was the policy and the manager doesn't allow chair moving. She didn't voice a solution. Then I looked over and saw the chair that should've been at our table was at the one with the booths against the wall. ""But clearly she took the chair from our table, and that chair is unoccupied and it isn't busy, so why not?"" What happened next was pretty....off putting. She said ""You want me to ask her to give you her chair back?"" Really.  Yes. What? Am I in 8th grade?  #1, that isn't what I said. #2, are you really arguing with 4 thirsty customers about a chair?   We looked at each other and left. We had a great time at the Lost Leaf and we could move chairs where ever the hell we want.  She wasn't apologetic and even if it is the manager's policy, he isn't there. Did she think we were manager chair narcs?  You could have been mine ""4 LYFE"" Roosevelt as I stated when you first opened, but given your disdain for hospitality and respect for your customers, I see no need to go back. Enjoy that empty chair."|review|mfvezpz6ohS0NQk3DZdvqQ|12|16|20

The kids meal prices were steep I thought at 5 bucks, but like the yelper below me stated, you get plenty of food, and I actually only bought two kids meals for my 3 kids, and they didn't even finish them, they were so full.  The kids thought it was great, I got the bbq slider and chicken strips for the kiddos.  I didn't go for bbq, I was going to, but then I noticed that they had a bacon wrapped deep fried dog with coleslaw on the menu.  I love coleslaw, and have never tried a dog made like that, so I had to give it a try.  The bread was nothing to hooo hawww about, but dog was fantastic, and the coleslaw is great!  What a good combo!  I will go back to order there family meal, which sounds like a great deal!  It would be better if they had more sides, but on the other hand, when a place only has a few things to choose from, those few things are usually great!

The wraps were straight up rubber. The filling was like well........wet cat food. I have personally wrapped a few thousand of theese AND cooked them and this was a poor attempt at best. Our food hit the table 30 secs later. Kudos the chef for the timing. Mongolian beef was good. I like the thick slices of beef but a little overkill on the scallions. Now desert. . Ugh.....flourless chocolate cake. Staight out of the box and fridge. No bueno. Not to mention our waitress said they messed it up 3 times in back. Then dumped an astoundingly gross amount of raspberry on plate and got it out 15 mins later. Our server was nice and did her job....and thanks to the bartender for the grasshoper! They are the only reason I gave 2 stars. Wont be back for that food at $14 bucks a plate! Im goin back to totties!|review|HcTrhG1w1qbCMBttHrU5iA|1|2|1

Then we just started enjoying it randomly throughout the month. After awhile, we noticed the quality slipping. Frozen potatoes would show up in the vegetables and the meat was overpoweringly marinated. Some of the nicer items began disappearing from the platters.  Then we dropped our visits back to special occasions, namely New Years. We've been for three years in a row and have noticed a steady decline. Prices are rising, quality is falling and we were surprised to find out that booths would cost us an extra $35 per person (we passed a few empty ones that remained that way for the rest of the evening).   They weren't even able to give us our traditional photo (which is part of the New Years package) and they had switched to cheap paper frames.  Honestly, they have gone down hill. If you are used to decent quality food for your money, there are better places. I suggest Firebird's (much cheaper) or Mastro's City Hall (delicious but expensive) if you like steak.   The New Years package includes $25 off a meal one per table coupons and honestly we are so disappointed with them we won't even give them away to friends and family.   Our server was wonderful by the way and our disappointment in no way reflects on him.   For the money you are paying, they should hold themselves to a higher standard.|review|heNB_wEsFw7J3bfcpnkrlQ|0|0|0

My DH ordered a sausage sandwich and was concerned about ""just how spicy is it?"" Jackie said it wasn't ""that hot"" but it had a kick to it. Spice is subjective and to us it was very spicy. Jackie was very attentive as she was working many areas and hustling, she was quick to apologize and asked to bring him something else.  DH ordered an Italian Beef Sandwich as a substitute. It was delicious. They use a Havarti cheese that gives a nice taste that we haven't found anywhere else.  The sandwich was moist and juicy A+. Made me wish I had ordered one instead of my flat cheese pizza, but he was nice enough to share  = )  The waffle cut fries were also a hit.  The manager could not have been nicer and stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking twice. Adam/manager and Jackie would be reason enough for us to come back again....not to mention that sandwich!

The place is so clean, I am positive I could eat off the floors, the tables or even the cool looking highchairs for the kiddos. Its kinda funny to see them vacuum up any messes or crumbs after someone goes through to select toppings, but they must mean business when they try to stay so sparkling clean and bright.    The staff is so friendly and attentive as you walk in the door and explain the concept and flavors, including allowing you to try a little taste of the various kinds of yogurts. I always want to know what the most popular / best seller is and they said its been the oatmeal cookie. It tastes just like an oatmeal cookie. So good. But, I don't have a super sweet tooth, so I ended up doing the tart flavor and added some fresh fruit on top.   I have nothing bad or negative to say about this place. Its really good.

Server was very mechanical and short. Since others bring the food, what else dies she have to do except check on us and keep our drinks filled? Sad. We ordered the Italian Market Salad which we usually split. It used to be a very finely chopped mountain of lettuce with great veggies, Garbanzo beans, cheese, meat etc. Now it has a small handful of white, droopy iceberg lettuce, tons of dressing and lots of white cheese balls. I could not finish my half (I was starving buy it was too gross) so we quickly paid and left. At this point even Taco Bell or Chipotle sounded good!   So sad..|review|Oqsgdm-ViX65dVqUVOjlIA|0|0|0

While it's certainly not terrible, you can definitely find better.  The quality of the pizza tends to be somewhat inconsistent  and at times can be quite good while at other times we've received a soggy crust with toppings that look like the kitchen staff must have had a contest to see who could stand on the other side of the kitchen and toss the most ingredients onto the crust (sadly, most of them missed).  The veggie salad was good and had interesting ingredients like avocado, green beans, white beans, and jicama that added enough zing to make the salad less than boring.  The caesar salad, however, was another story.  We were about halfway through eating it when we finally pinpointed the source of the strange taste and texture that is unfamiliar to a typical caesar.  About 1/3 of what is normally romaine lettuce actually consisted of chopped celery, which in my opinion, has no place in a caesar salad.  I'm not sure if this was just an attempt at cutting costs by adding a cheap filler ingredient, but the result was anything but delicious.  On a positive note, they do offer half priced bottles of wine on Mondays, but overall, this is just an average pizza restaurant.|review|2qnz2y_Z1nDo2HqqfxJxSA|1|1|1

Despite having more games and a wider variety, of the two times I've been, there haven't been too many customers. It seemed pretty dead.

When it gets too late to go anyplace else and I need something to eat Church's is close and easy and fast and cheap. Not only that but it tastes good. I usually prefer dark meat but sometimes I forget to tell them and get white meat, either way it's extremely moist and tender and juicy.  I've never gotten a bad batch with an unacceptable coating or meat.   The biscuits are so good I want to eat them like cookies! I've gotten a half gallon of the sweet tea for 2 bucks on sale in hot weather and it lasted me several days in my motel room.  I tried the Apple Turnover once and it was very good. This trip I've gotten the $2.99 special two different times that has a biscuit with 2 pieces of chicken, usually a thigh and leg but today I got a thigh and a breast.  It's a fast easy meal if it's too late to go to a restaurant and it keeps well in the motel fridge too. On past trips I've  sometimes stopped by and gotten 3 or 4 pieces just to keep in the refrigerator so that if I don't feel like going out to eat I've got something on hand.    Oh, and I went to Popeyes a few weeks ago expecting to get a good fried chicken and it was so horribly salty I couldn't eat it. Church's Chicken has never let me down.  Even the mashed potatoes and gravy weren't bad. They certainly weren't  overly salty even though I know they were made from a mix.

Lets explore the Kyle Day comment. He books a band to headline a Friday night, the place is open well past midnight and the headline band announces at 9:35 ""this is our last song, thanks for coming"". Then he gets to argue with some lymie prick manager for 20 minutes about why the band is only playing for 35 minutes. Then he gets to refund cover charges to people who paid to see the band. Then he asks the band that played before Silent Film to come back onstage and play for the people who are still there. If you would have noticed the place was full because people came to see Ashley sing. Back to Kyle Days master plan, so he does all this before 10:00 P.M. You are probably right, this was a huge money making night to have the headline band quit at 9:35. I hope Danny Zelesko or Live Nation don't get wind of this it is ""brilliant"".

I ordered the 1/2 chicken and it was very moist although I would say that it was much saltier than I expected - I have had Peruvian chicken elsewhere and never found it that salty.  But - and here is the weird thing - I reacted to it after we left.  I reacted as I do when I have MSG.  So whatever they put on it - I can't have it again - if you are MSG reactive, you might ask before ordering.  The chicken came with rice and salad.  The rice seemed to be cooked in a garlic water perhaps?  It was plain white rice with a slight garlicy flavor. Nothing remarkable about it.  DH had Loma Saltado, a stir-fried beef with veggies over fries.  I didn't taste it but he found it was rather bland.  Again, we expect it to be a little spicier.  The portion was large and it was freshly prepared though.  He ordered a side salad which was iceberg with tomatoes.  For $3, I don't expect a bevy of veggies, but I don't expect a plate of iceberg either.  The salad dressing was a very thin yogurt-based dressing that didn't seem to have much flavor. Again, nothing bad, just very bland.  We had ordered special fried corn - sort of like corn nuts only not as flavorful.  Finally we thought we would salvage the date night with a slice of flan to split.  It is apparent to me - as I bake and cook a lot - that the flan was not all that fresh as it tasted of ""refrigerator"". Meh.  One thing that makes me curious - we ordered and were charged for the corn - but I notice now that everyone says that they received it free as a ""table nosh"" - i wonder if we had to pay for it since we had a Groupon???"|review|YZaIJvg38rlYKwPlsgYc-A|0|0|1

The ONLY reason they don't get that fifth star is because they wouldn't help me retrieve my ATM from the outside ATM.  They could have asked the Brinks folks to bring it in next time they emptied the machine, but just resisted and resisted.

It was a Monday night and they were caught off guard with a busy rush because of holiday shoppers and family in town, etc.  So service wasn't the greatest but I am in the business, so I understand getting caught off guard on a night when you are usually slow. I had the fajitas, they were tasty.  If I remember correctly, the chicken was great, the steak not so great.  Very fatty.  It was pretty oily, but isn't that what makes food so good?!!   The chips and salsa were ok, nothing special.  I wish they had chimichangas on their menu, and maybe the do now, since I heard they added new items.

Every time I activated the ""carpet"" setting, the base would would buzz and shake like I sucked up a pile of rocks. More than that, the ""floor"" mode barely maintained suction.  Frustrating to say the least.   Calling around, I landed on Park Ridge because five star reviews are nothing to overlook. The owner informed me that they'll fix Dyson's except for the Ball type. I brought it in on Tuesday, showing up right as the owner was locking up the for the day. He empathized about how bad the traffic can get on Shea and took me in. I explained the symptoms and it sounded like he knew the problem right away. Along with replacing a belt, he offered to swap out my HEPA filter and give her the full rundown.  I came back to pick up my Dyson on Friday. After a quick test at home, I'm happy to say she's back to nearly brand new condition. These guys were fast and thorough, even knocking off a couple bucks because I opted to pay cash. All said and done, it cost me around $120, which is not bad when you realize that replacing one of these vacuums can cost two to three times more."|review|ajYMtA6UN8nn9Dz7nFbLdg|1|0|1

If you are thinking about flying in from out of town to visit Schwartz, I do not recommend it.  I live in Los Angeles, and decided to have LASIK in Phoenix because I have family out there who could drive me to and from both appointments.  I booked a flight, took time off of work, and had a family remember request both days off of work so they could drive me to the appointments.  I received a call yesterday that they needed to reschedule because Dr. Schwartz was going out of town.  I reminded them that I am specifically flying in for this appointment (and she even confirmed this information was in my file... meaning, they knew about this prior to calling me), but the receptionist just said ""I know, we are really frustrated too.""  Right, but the receptionist didn't just waste a couple hundred dollars on a flight and ask family members to take time off work.    To top it off, I received both a text message and an email this morning confirming my appointment for next week.  Call me crazy, but if you are going to cancel appointments last minute, you probably don't want to send out confirmations directly afterward.    I'm shocked at the level of customer service I received from a doctor that is in the business of performing elective surgery (that can cost upwards of $5,000!).  It seems as though other people have had great experiences with Schwartz... I just wish I could've been one of them."|review|9i5_f6-Y57iPpPIgKX6w8g|0|0|0

It was the third visit to this establishment. The last two times I had what I think is called The Vermonter, a turkey sandwich with apples and cranberry mayo. They were delicious. The third time I went, I ordered a French Dip. A friend ordered one the last time we had gone and it looked good. After ordering, my two friends and I sat. After a couple of minutes, the man I believe is a manager or the owner told the guy in the back, ""That's too much meat. Take it out."" I thought that there was no way he was referring to my sandwich. I was sitting right there, after all. If you've been inside the shop, you know the inner seating is tiny. You can sit anywhere in there and know what everyone is saying.   Then it showed up. He was talking about my sandwich alright. The meat was gone.   Who does that?! Even if the sandwich maker had put too much, would you ask it be taken out within ear shot of the customer?   My friends looked at my face and they knew. They knew this sandwich shop was dead to me and that we wouldn't be eating here again. I was so angry I didn't even taste the sandwich. I just silently shoveled in what I had payed for and left with my office buddies, stomach only half-full with broth-dipped bread.  I wasn't rude or overly nice when I ordered. Just, y'know, normal. Cordial, I'd say.  I had a coupon.  Was that the problem?  Thinking back on it, I still find the whole thing bizarre."|review|vCqiNuf7iEK71ytGBzwkKg|3|4|4

I stopped walking, tipped the pizza box, and saw liquid pouring out of it onto the ground.   I went back into the restaurant, and someone took the pizza back into the kitchen.  After about a minute, a manager-type came out of the kitchen, opened the register, and started counting out some bills.   I thought: ""What a classy place!  Since my clothes might have been ruined and the pizza now must obviously be subpar, he's refunding my money.""   Wrong.   He was evidently just making change from the register.   Then the person who had taken the box back to the kitchen came out and handed me a boxed pizza with no explanation.   I looked at her questioningly.   She said the liquid was because of the veggies that I had ordered.   In other words, it was my fault.  We've ordered plenty of mushroom-olive-onion pizzas before, from other places and from the old Barro's, but never before have we had any amount of liquid coming out -- let alone a large amount, as in this case.   And now the pizza was in a new, un-warmed box, so it was going to be cold.     I had forgotten to order the pizza with a thin crust.   When I opened the box at home, I found that the cuts in the thick pizza dough did not go all the way through.   So in addition to having a poor, cold, dry pizza, we now had to struggle with our pizza cutter as well.  My clothes were machine-washable, but it would have been very bad if I had had a big food-liquid spill all over my car.     This experience was a poor one, and I won't be going back there."|review|ODyaekriMPJ4Pk8TcX5g2g|1|2|1

I figured, how can a nicer restaurant be in a strip mall next to a video place and ace hardware.  But I read the reviews and thought, it's close to home, why not try it out.  That many people can't be wrong about it.  I almost drove by the location, as the sign over the top is very plain.    When you walk in, it is very dark.  The decor is simple and only a few things have been updated since whatever else was there originally (my guess was Peter piper pizza).  I was seated and it took awhile for the waitress to come to the table to get our drink order.  The waitress seemed a little off sort that evening and didn't seem to be paying attention.  We ordered our drinks and about 15-20 mins later, the drinks came to the table.  We regretted not ordering an appetizer while we ordered our drinks as it took awhile for our waitress to come back to the table.  I had the sangria, which was absolutely delicious.  I actually ordered 2!  The food was delivered fast and fresh!  We had mussels and olives for an appetizer, I had the chopped chicken salad and my date had the steak and fries.  The steak was cooked just like it was ordered and the fries were crispy and delicious.  We ordered dessert and had the bread pudding.  I'm usually not a bread pudding type of gal, this was hands down one of the best bread puddings I have had.  It was garnished with raspberries and the bread wasn't soggy!

Their food is also really lovely.    I had the Buddha's feast (from the traditional menu) and the Orange Chicken (yup...the everyone else menu) and I loved both! The vegetables were crisp, tasty and weren't overwhelmed by the light sauce...and the Orange Chicken...drooling...sooo good! They slice it into these strips and flash fry it. NO heavy breading, and the sauce was super sticky, sweet, and tangy.  Washed it all down with an effervescent and cheap (nice, right?)

Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars!   I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on.  Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had!   The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit.   My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect!   I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!|review|4UUIpbOTPmu43wuC2aSGkg|13|11|17

I love the atmosphere of the small house. This is a huge part of its charm. The staff was kind, and friendly, and very personable. They unexpectedly brought out a desert for me with a ""Congratulations Graduate"" inscribed with chocolate sauce (bonus!) on the outer rim of the plate. The service alone would make me come back.  But the food. OH. MY. GOD. the FOOD!  I had no expectations going to this restaurant, as i had no idea what it was, or that we were even going until an hour before i arrived. I had no time to do research, and i trust my parents palate to have chosen a sufficient place for dinner. (they did pretty good being from Texas, thanks to you yelpers!)  What we ordered:  To start: the Brie Brulee--INCREDIBLE Three Onion Tart--from the one bite i was able to sneak in from my dad (who fell in love at first taste) it was delicious  I had the Salmon, which was wonderful. Flaky, and moist, and the creme sauce was devine. I don't think i expected it to be as heavy as the dish was, but even so...wonderful. I would probably have enjoyed it more if it were cold outside.  My dad ordered the lamb shank, and it was falling off the bone. I had never had lamb until that day, and i'm glad my first time was at Coup Des Tartes! It was savory, and succulent, and with the vegetables it came with, reminded me of a stew.  My mom had the Pasta, and it was just right! Very light and flavorful, which paired well with the wine we brought.  My brother ordered the Chicken, and while it was one of the ""simpler"" dishes, it was the best tasting of them all.  The execution from start to finish is something that will not go unmentioned when i recommend this little gem. Keep up the great work! I can't wait to come back!"|review|j2Zx2PYK7TdxtEPlvRmD1w|0|0|0
hZRLGfRrZTo9up2P-0aAHg|2010-06-26|rv0kCPNbVp5USiBfQ2vd6Q|4|Tried this place yesterday for lunch and really enjoyed it.  I had the Green Chili Pork with the corn tortillas (just like corn better).  The pork had great flavor and spice.  I did request a small cup of their extra spicy salsa, which actually had a hint of sweetness to it but good.  I liked the beans and rice as well.  The horchata was very tasty and a good balance to my lunch.    For those not into meat I was there with a veggie eater and he enjoyed the no lard black beans with the veggie tacos (again corn tortillas here to avoid animal products).    I will be back to try another dish here for sure.  Also, it is nice that they have free parking in the back instead of filling the meter.|review|qyR0lCqq1-H6q8HAyrG6bw|0|0|0

Iuml1UUgrAX1HyU50IWBEw|2013-06-08|rF8tZ-mFfAUyyuWgx0QWKA|1|After a fantastic trip around Arizona, staying in excellent budget and independent motels, the last hotel I thought I would take issue with is a Hilton property. They got just about everything wrong. We arrived promptly at 3PM, to find out that our room wasn't ready. As per my HH profile, we were supposed to be on a high floor away from the elevator. As they scrambled to get a room ready, we were put on a low floor near the elevator. Strike one.   We were on an early flight and I need to return our rental car the night before, in order to qualify for the weekly rate. I confirmed ahead of time that the Hilton provided a courtesy shuttle to AND from Sky Harbor. This was actually the 100% main reason that I booked at this property. When I called to arrange it, the ditz at the front desk provided poor instructions and so I ended up waiting outside for over a half hour - given my early flight time, this is time I would have liked to have been sleeping. When I tried to explain to the front desk ditz how to explain to people where to stand to get the shuttle, she gave me attitude and fobbed me off to a manager (have yet to receive a call back). Strike two.   Worst of all, when I finally got up there for me 5 or so hours of sleep, the mattress was ROCK HARD. I mean, I prefer a firm mattress myself, but this was just ridiculous. It had no give and the headboard and frame creaked with every movement. Strike three.   If you read my other reviews of Arizona properties, you'll see that I'm not a crank who just writes poor reviews. But this place deserved it. On first appearance, it seems like a very good property - but it seriously lacks where it counts. Instead of Conrad Hilton, this place reminded me more of Paris Hilton!|review|qwUVxKAAFKP-gJ983TjEsQ|1|1|3

Started with a plate of 3 different bruschetta appetizers that were excellent.  Then had a choice of 2 salads, 2 meats - we had turkey that was served with a focaccia dressing and the tilapia served with a side of some of the best creamed spinach I ever had - then 2 side dishes in addition - mashed sweet potatoes and mashed garlic potatoes that were just okay - 2 pasta dishes - we had the signature Rigatoni D and the angel hair with pomodoro sauce/sausage - and 2 desserts!  It is a little pricey, but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers, I think it's worth it.  The best way to go here is with a group and do the family style menu.

Our coffee cups never hit empty.   I ordered the potato pancakes and they hit the spot. They were actually pretty dang tasty!

We haven't been to Schnepf's in about 10 years but my husband's company rented the farm out last weekend for a large scale corporate event, I am SO glad we chose to go.  First, I need to clarify that it was a free event for our family so we did not have to pay for anything at all.  Parking was very adequate even though it was crowded, we didn't have a long walk at all.  Food lines were a little long but worth the wait-pulled pork was our favorite along with the roasted corn and cornbread.  Chili was canned and the chicken was more like chicken jerky but the hot dogs were mighty tasty!  We also had kettle korn, popcorn and candy since it was complimentary as well.  The rides are really fun and suitable for almost all ages.  We rode the coaster and laughed so hard, super cool!!  The teens did the slide, the swings and the bee ride and enjoyed them all.  We rode the pedal bike course, our husbands pedaled us through and it was hilarious.  I really wanted to try the new jumping pillows, they looked like huge bouncers but flush with the ground, but we ran out of time :(  The ""Spooky Train"" was a hit, with scary monsters and clowns.  My daughter is terrified of clowns so of course, she about crapped her pants-worth the whole trip!  We ended the night with roasting marshmellows at a campfire-YUMMY!!!!!  They also offered but we missed:  BMX Bike Stunt Show, Pig Races and Dog Show.  Schnepf's also had a live band playing during the evening which was very good!  They have  several stores and a bakery and I do believe they have brunch and serve breakfast during events throughout the year.

OJG6XEdu2EB60r6OxLFsCg|2009-11-10|byYHXanHSNWZq_cAYxQ1hg|4|As a Filipino in Phoenix it's hard to find Filipino restaurants in Phoenix especially Tagalog Filipino cooking. Most Filipinos in Phoenix are illocano or Visayan and there really isn't alot of Filipino restaurants to try so when my mom and I saw a banner outside of Mekong Plaza of a Filipino grill that just opened, I made sure that the next time I found myself at Mekong I'd stop and try it out. Anywho, Wholly Grill is owned by a Cebuana, and they specialize in grilling hence the name. There are usually two things I'll try out at a Filipino restaurant and that is their barbeque and the house special. In this case it was the pork barbeque and the Liempo (grilled pork belly). Chona the owner was pulling out all the stops to get people to try out her place hence the 4 stars coz she was giving out samples. The barbeque was not sweet which was good and not too saucy! I think that's what people are not big fans of and that's sugar sweet filipino food. The Liempo was not fatty nor salty and with the 2 scoops of rice and the macaroni salad (pinoy style with the raisins) along with two pork bbq sticks for around $10 it wasn't a bad deal. I just wish she had sago or Halo-Halo. But it's not bad, and if I need a Filipino fix I'll stop by at Wholly Grill! you should too!|review|ROr4DQ-gxlfUKmiDC-qSEQ|3|2|6

zOCdVUKUN3b-obT67Qjyww|2009-08-23|-xnVBAjEpZDGG2blHuebMw|4|I have been to Haus Murphy's numerous times, each time was a different experience.  The quality of the food seems to differ from one visit to the next. The size of the portions is rather constant, which is nice. During my last visit, my wife and I dined with another couple. We ordered the giant pretzel, which was a solid selection. Very tasty, not too salty. During previous visits, we have ordered the sausage sampler and were pleased by the flavor and the generous portions.  My wife and one of our friends ordered the same entree, however, the difference in presentation and quality of the two dishes was evident the moment they were placed on the table. Not too sure how a chef could allow for two entrees heading to the same place to be so noticeably different.  We sat in the bar area, which is my favorite. There is a large television which displays various sporting events. I happen to enjoy sporting events with fried food, what can I say? The beers are delicious, true German brews served in massive glasses. I prefer the 32oz Hefe. The beer is never a disappointment and is reasonably priced.  Haus Murphy has a new menu. The number of dishes has shrunk and the prices have gone up. Not a big deal initially, I understand it's a sign of the times. However, I was shocked to see my final bill. I ordered a side of sauce for my schnitzel that amounted to five dollars. Wow. A quarter of a cup of mushroom sauce for five dollars. Next time, I will do without.  Also, our waitress asked if we would like to split the bill as couples. We accepted. However, she returned to the table and informed us that she had tallied the beers incorrectly. She didn't offer to correct her mistake and instead left us figure out the details which she offered to take care of. A little unprofessional, but the difference of a few dollars wasn't a huge deal.  Overall, the experience wasn't as great as it once was, food and service alike. However, I still enjoy the majority of the food options and I will always love the beer. To me, this is enough to award four stars. Am I happy with the new menu and the diminished service? No, but I'll get over it. Just stop the slide, Haus.|review|syF-6VzPdjmCXbTye6N9Eg|1|1|1

Nothing was good, I'm sad to report. The sweet and sour soup had such an odd overly bitter taste, it really wasn't edible. I ordered their version of Happy Family and the ""spicy brown sauce"" was watery, sweet and made the veggies soggy. My husband ordered the bell pepper chicken, which was just OK.  We got our order to go, otherwise I would have sent the soup and my dish back. And maybe would have had a different experience...  We've had such a hard time finding a good traditional chinese place in Phoenix."|review|viizjKdHXHcMEG9jvmCRwQ|1|1|2

W6CL0xexbcBP6KNPKMNrTw|2013-11-17|6UwhhayTRCJe4PeT-X0z-A|1|"Just had it out with the pharmacist, who I can't even believe passed pharmacy school.  We came about 9pm right after my surgery. I am in a rental car so I am the only one who can drive it, so even though I had emergency surgery, I still had to drive. Anyway we went through the drive through. We came close to 10 so the pharmacist who by the way looks Chubacca, (so you'll know her when you see her!) had a bad attitude from the get. Anyway I was given 3 prescriptions which needed to be filled, this meaning WORK for her big lazy ass! She slowly and RUDELY took my info, then told me it would be 30 minutes and waddled away. At least that was pretty quick, so I said ok and preceded to return some texts and emails in the drive through while waiting, with no one behind me of course. Seeing me out the corner of her coke bottle glasses, she STORMED back over, ""HEY, HEY, LADY, you cant sit there, you need to move it NOW!"" She told me (even MORE RUDELY)  ""Move along now!"" and she Shoo-ed me away with her spastic hand motions...HOW RUDE! So I finished what I was doing, maybe 3 seconds, hunted for the gear shifter in the rental, that took a another second or 2, then, I can barely move my legs due to the surgery so pressing the gas took me a couple more, so I am sure I looked like a disobedient smart ass to Pharmacist Elnas AKA Chubacca, and clearly yes... I am quite the smartass, but I wasn't being I was just in INTENSE PAIN!  Hello people don't usually end up in the pharmacy at their best right? Which means they should have be pretty damn good by now at customer service when working there, No!??  Anyway she then RUDELY told me how she wasn't going to fill my prescription now.  ""Hahha oh ok Miss(ssss), guess what? Now I don't feel comfortable filling this."" ""I don't like you so that is my right."" She said. YOUR RIGHT? You don't like ME? Not my attitude, not my pain or even my seemingly smart ass too slow for even your slow ass movement...but you don't like ME, CHUBACCA?  ""I have done nothing wrong, what are you talking about, I am in PAIN!"" I exclaimed! ""Great so take a walk on in the store then and I'll fill it in here."" She said.  I responded AN, ""I can't walk lady, I just got out of emergency surgery!""  ""Too bad here is a CVS down the street."" She said, and she waddled away.  That is when I flipped. I laid on the horn until she returned, asked for her name and license. Told her she was going to lose her job, at some point after she told me she wasn't going to fill it I started recording video of which I played a portion of for so could see herself and how she was acting. MIRACULOUSLY she apologized.  ""Please don't complain."" she said,  ""I'll give you a gift card!"" She said.  ""I'll fill your prescription.""  ""Sorry it's just store policy.""  Hmmm that attitude you just watched your self give on tape, is that CVS store policy too? Funny what people start to offer when they see what their boss and the Arizona State Board of Pharmaceutical Licensing will see. Not to mention the attitude, the customer service and the blatant disregard for human well being & discrimination for the half crippled blonde with a doctors recommendation for pills because she just rolled off the surgery table! AHHHHHH.  Whatever she rectified it. I got a $25 gift card to go with my now higher blood pressure. Still, it that was my grandma she was treating like that? Or yours. Or some other sore half crippled person in pain, or bad health or sickness. I just wouldn't want to have not done my part. I'm still going to complain... 1. To you, fellow Yelpers!  2. To her boss 3. To corporate CVS 4. To the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy So good luck Pharmacist Elnas Chubacca, may your days in some other industry be plenty and bright! And may your days of wanting to be fat and lazy because your shift is almost over, and when someone doesn't get your happy little I went to pharmacy school and now I work at CVS power trip...be few and far between. STOP BEING RUDE to people who don't want to be there in the first place, when you are the one getting paid, WELL, to be there filling little bottles, when you probably don't want to be either. There are too many other people who need good jobs!  I will never go back to the Chubacca CVS. Not even to use my $25 gift card. I will take her advice and go to the one down the street. And when I stop for gas? I hope she is the attendant behind the counter serving up slurpees, oh wait, with that attitude, she doesn't even deserve that position. Go talke some customer service classes you RUDE mean person. See, I can be mean too! But I didn't call you Chubacca once! I was probably TOO nice to you which is why I needed to get all this out. DON'T send your prescriptions, your family or friends...let alone your hard earned dollars to this store or pharmacy. Unless you are looking for bribes for dealing with Chubacca, after all RUDE jerks need jobs too right? Attitude is everything folks. Ah ha! I feel much better, thanks Yelp!"|review|W46pJ-F_tPcJRW_u5fc2TA|0|0|0

I love when I can get a burger with avocado, different cheeses besides cheddar, roasted red peppers and tell them how I want it cooked.  The truffle fries are a must!  And I wouldn't leave without getting the salted creme brulee milkshake, but split it as it is pretty large and rich.  I loved that the interior of this place was so modern, but they still had a bar where you could and they had the Monday night football game on.  This burger joint is fancier than most, but prices match the experience you will have and quality of food you will get.  Would go again!|review|FQFsuPE8C3lppg7sZoRFRg|0|0|0

I enjoyed the best meal I've ever had in my 7.5 years living in Phoenix at Razz's earlier this year.  I couldn't even tell you all the delicious things I ate now, but that's exactly the point.  I didn't order for myself - I sat at the bar and ordered the Chef's tasting menu.  Razz himself decided what he wanted us to have and stayed with us thoughout the entire meal.  He is quite the entertainer and a very interesting man, to boot.  He knows his food is good and he will certainly be happy to tell you!  The time he takes off during the summer he spends traveling the world and tasting food from all over, so he knows how his cuisine measures up.

fPExBO1aXA5c4uwlHFyx2Q|2011-12-24|p79AAEgMacW2NxABvgUDUg|3|Nice Italian restaurant in a strip mall. Once inside, you forget that you're in Arizona.  The food was average, but service impeccable. In fact, I was beyond disappointed in the flavor of the food as I had heard so many positive comments on this restaurant.   The escargot appetizer was the best of everything we tried. Dipping the tasty garlic bread in the hot butter sauce is a great way to clean up the appetizer. Every other food item just seemed to be missing something. The house salad with blue cheese was okay. Very mild tasting. Youbarely taste the dressing and the mozzarella garnered more of the attention. The salad definitely could have used some blue cheese crumbles. The crab bisque had a decent flavor, but you could tell fake crab was used. The chicken, veal and spinach cannelloni was far too mushy and needed a little more meatiness to it. The Veal Mario was very flavorful with the sun dried tomatoes, but the meat was overcooked. The Shrimp and Scallop Antoinette had the best combination of flavors of all the dishes. Shrimp a little overdone, but scallops were cooked perfect, as was the pasta. Great dish! The meatball side dish we shared as a table (you get two) were dry and had no flavor. I expected a lot more from meatballs from a true Italian restaurant.   The service was incredible with very knowledgeable and friendly staff. They always had water glasses filled and the waiter (Nick) timed and served the different courses of the meal perfectly. We never felt rushed or like we we're waiting too long for the next item.   While the flavor of the food was not at the level I expected, Uncles Sal's is worth a try. I'll be back as the service was great, and maybe the cooks were just having an off night!|review|HtYubOiwaa2yrVI1vUvOyw|0|0|2

After that, be sure to stop by the Plaza Bar where Istvan serves up an amazing whiskey mojito (it's not on the menu, but but sure to check it out.)   Since you won't be able to leave after just one drink, take a minute to meet Jessica and Fernando,  the other talented mixologists. If you don't want to belly up to the bar, no problem. Brian, Karianne and Vivian will help you choose a libation to hit the spot. This team is also  a wealth if resources if you have any questions about the area. After a few drinks, if you're feeling hungry, try the Grape tomato and Mini Bocconcini duo for a tasty take on a caprese salad.   You'll most likely want to stop by the pool after that. While you're there, Meredith will take extra great care of you! I suggest you situate yourself on the West side of the pool. It's a little less crowded and there aren't typically as many people meandering about.  I'm sure you'll be ready for a nap after your time at the lounge and the pool...so before you seek refuge in the beautiful and spacious rooms, stop by the ponds to the south of the pool where there is usually a family of turtles and an interesting collection of birds hanging around.  No matter where you decided to spend your trip, the Fairmont team always delivers extraordinary customer service and a one-of-a-kind experience that has people like myself loyally staying here for years.|review|WMUUXFWT0KeAUN9NV8FrXg|0|0|0

Found a local lady who bakes cakes and she had a Mother's Day special for a dz of all assorted flavor mini macaron sampler so I ordered 2 dz to try out. They were ok but not impressed as though were different flavors, the fillings were pretty much all buttercream/sweet cream which I did not care for. I didnt know what to compare it to since I've never had macarons before but thought I'd try elsewhere. I checked on here and read upon the raving reviews for Essence Bakery so decided to make a trip to check it out when I was in town. I ordered 3 of the large macarons (strawberry, espresso and vanilla) and wow! What a difference! They were so yummy! I wanted to get 1 of every flavor but it was alittle $ but then again, they were big macarons and the minis were too small wince I was sharing them with my daughter to try the flavors out. My daughter loved the strawberry and vanilla ones too. Too bad (or maybe it's a good thing or I might be in trouble) it's so far away from me but I difinitely plan on going there again to try out the other flavors next time I'm ever in the area or close to it again.|review|E5OkyMmqE1hCrULWCbOSyQ|1|0|1

Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant,  who ever they are,  to read it and wake up. Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this place.  Let's start at the beginning, went for lunch, walked in, saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us. NOPE!! nothing of the sorts, walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance, again what do I do next? People inside look at you but don't ask to help you. We had our dog with us, so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out. She walked to the counter and again no one would help. Can I order? Then a person replied and pointed ""you start down there"" Okay great, were getting somewhere. She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade. she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table, I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich""    I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm?) and she went to get the sandwich.  OH the daymare has just started. After about 20 minutes, she sent me a text and said,"" I haven't left you, still waiting"" This is Chicken Salad People!!! slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go. Here's where it gets really good, several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella. My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting, she taps on the window and asks "" is there a problem with the chicken salad.""  ""I'll check""  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich.  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes, and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said ""how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich"" he had been waiting 30 minutes.  We eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food, nothing to write home about, and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous, I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  ""This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return""  Their response, exactly like the whole experience started. NOTHING.  And although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere, so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICED."|review|a06ztkoxHRiMNc9hAxtpqA|0|1|1

Nice digs, with a cafe kind of feel (although I think they have a separate dining area) that serves pretty awesome sandwiches at a good price.  I stopped in for lunch as I was cruising 60 headed from Las Vegas to Phoenix.  There isn't a whole lot going on Wickenburg, but this place is right on the main drag and was open (both good things).  I got a sandwich and some sort of lemonade, and both were good.  The sandwich options were vast, but the bread choices left something to be desired considering all they had was sliced bread.  I am of the roll/hoagie/focacia/anything that isn't sliced bread camp and part of the reason is durability.  My bread couldn't contain the fresh and delicious meat, cheese, and veggies (including sprouts!!!) that were piled high inside.  The veggies were crisp and thick cut and the meat (turkey I believe) was fine as well.  It is also pretty large and I had to take the sandwich down over two sittings, but for the price it really is a great deal.  Loved the feel, with a definite southwest kinda vibe, even though the space inside is open and almost bordering on a hippie tip, or at least a healthy conscious fancy coffee drinking tip that is decidedly un-cowboy.  Either way if I am ever stopping in Wickenburg again I will hit up Nana's for sure.|review|Di3SsySwjxHw9UfeJw_fxQ|2|1|2

wNUea3IXZWD63bbOQaOH-g|2011-04-25|QA0XxUeqESBumyauhrKLnA|4|Stopped off at Biltmore Mall to get a bite to eat after my big iphone ordeal.  I have a new phone now so all is good, but it is surprisingly stressful to be without a cellphone even for a few HOURS. Yes, I'm that addicted to being on the grid.  Anyway.....  This is one of those fancy looking places sushi places where their location at the Biltmore mall is more of a plus than a detraction.  It's billed as a sushi place and indeed the sushi chefs I encountered all seemed to know their stuff. I sat at the sushi bar so I could hear then talking to the other customers about sushi selections and recommendations.   Tip: if you eat at the bar you get complimentary miso soup and edamame. The cilantro in my miso soup was a nice surprise. I usually like more traditional Japanese tastes, but I can appreciate a little kick now and then.  I was there early afternoon/evening and had a server who was in training. I had to have her re-do the check twice. The first mistake had and extra roll that I had not ordered.  And the second mistake was completely wrong, but at a 50% discount. I just want to pay what I'm supposed to pay so I called her attention to the bill a second time.   Aside from the those snafus, she was attentive  but she must have been really, really green as her nervousness was apparent. That's ok, everyone needs to start somewhere and she, at least, was trying smile a lot even though I'm sure she must have been stressed out.    The sushi chefs though rocked and I had a good time. I find that if I need to dine alone if I'm out on business, sushi bar is the perfect place. If I'm back in Scottsdale anytime soon, I'm sure I'll go back to Stingray again.|review|QnxwQy82MQa7ABg_nWQ0_A|1|0|1

I've visited most of the frozen yogurt shops around, and Dreams Swirls is my favorite for several reasons:  1) Great selection of flavors. They are great about putting out seasonal stuff in both their machines and in the toppings bars. The machines are always working (I think I saw one not functioning, once, and the repair guy was there) and the toppings are kept stocked and neat. The pumpkin spice and graham cracker combo they have going on right now is fabulous.  2) Nice folks. I'm a regular here, coming in at least once a week. There's something cozy about walking in and having the employee say, ""Hi! We've added in two new flavors since you were here last. Here are your sample cups.""   Oh yeah, they are awesome about their sample cups. Other yogurt places are stingy or almost suspicious about the whole sample thing; it makes me sad, because I do see how customers can abuse the system to get freebies and run. Dream Swirls is nice about it all, though.  3) Perks. The punch cards are a great incentive though I do wish I could go there more often on double punch Tuesdays. Ah well! They also offer coupons in store sometimes and coupons can be found on the Valupak website or mailers.  4) Location. This is the only yogurt place for miles around. There's certainly not one closer to where I live in Buckeye. This ends up being a very convenient stop when I'm at Safeway next door.  5) Facebook involvement. Keeping up with the technology is a big deal for me. If I'm going someplace, I look up their menu and/or their Facebook page. Dream Swirls updates their Facebook regularly with special offers and with flavor updates (i.e. what is low, what's coming in, what the full line up is). More than once I have seen some new flavor that makes me eager to get in there and try it."|review|Q0VuxHxMtoBgKr_hozBBNw|0|0|1

My friend and I just went for a light dinner.  So, we ended up getting the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus and some Tzatziki.  Wow, I forgot how awesome the hummus is at Pita Jungle, nice and spicy. If you have not been to Pita Jungle for hummus you are definitely missing out.      While when we were trying to pay for our bill, our service was telling us that the credit card server was down and that we can only pay with cash.  First of all you never tell your customers that you can only take cash at a restaurant when they take credit card too.  Second you can write down the credit card number on a credit card slip and then have the customer sigh it.  Third the guy was like you can wait around until the system comes back up.  Yeah no, we will just pay cash and leave.      Our server was very nice and kept our drinks filled the whole time we were there.  Normally I did not leave a 2 star rating, but that was just not acceptable for customer services.    Happy Yelping.|review|ysBQMZiuZ7VSu_YAh-lE0Q|4|2|5

I guess I don't go enough to know the rules because us girls got in for free, but I felt bad that the 3 guys that came with us had to pay ten bucks to get in with us!  The place was definitlely cool inside, lotsa places to sit (not sure if it cost extra). I thought the drinks were decent, definitely more on the strong side, but I'm not sure how much they cost since I didn't have to pay that night. I was dd, so needless to say, I didn't get nearly as drunk as my friends, who seemed to have a lot more fun! I'm not into getting hit on when I go out with friends, so the losers that did were all really douchey and/or drunk, one of whom I even submitted a picture to hotchickswithdouchebags.com. There were lots of them that night.   I think overall it can be a fun place if you get drunk enough, but if you're more of a low key dive bar type of girl like me, it's  prob not your scene either|review|cHoC_bpAfmsgdRhe04A3lw|0|0|0

We had a layover in Phoenix, so we grabbed some lunch here.  We ordered turkey sandwiches and a sea salt chocolate chip cookie.  The sandwiches were made on a soft high quality bread, a generous stack of sliced turkey breast, and fresh produce.  It was a large sandwich, which kept us full through our following flight.  After the sandwich we shared the cookie, and it was truly the best cookie I ever ate.  It was big and soft, yet it had slightly crispy edges, and was loaded with chocolate chips and sprinkled with sea salt. It had a lovely contrast of sweet and savory, and it was buttery and chocolaty.  This was the first time I had a cookie with sea salt, and I am totally hooked!  If I ever fly through Phoenix again, I will make sure to make at pit stop here!   Also next time I want to try pizzas, as they looked and smelled delicious!|review|g5auVfSai5YDW5Ng83-7Qw|2|2|2

I have hated every gluten free bread I've bought to date, so it has been FOREVER since I've have a sandwich.  I decided to take a risk on ordering one here, and I am so glad I did! One of the employees suggested that I try the Eggplant Italiano since I wanted something vegan and gluten free.  It was a yummy, messy (in a good way), hefty serving of roasted veggies, tomato sauce, and vegan cheese oozing with goodness on a hearty herb bread that was similar in size and consistency to a French roll.  It came with some Pop Chips that were really salty, which made me really happy but others might feel they were too salty.    For the baked goods, I read in another review that most are best eaten frozen or really cold, and I found that to be pretty true.  They are also expensive compared to regular baked goods.  I'm so thankful to have found tasty GF/vegan goodies that I don't really care about the temperature.  Considering the price of GF ingredients at grocery and health food stores, I understand the prices here.  About the ambiance, it is very basic, which I liked.  It reminded me of all the little hole-in-the-wall pizzerias and hot dog places I used to eat at when I was younger and didn't care what I ate.  I wish they stayed open later!   I will definitely be going back, probably tomorrow already!|review|KT3lcqBcfNWuDqd2X3mQpw|0|0|1

The Coachhouse has some good beer on tap and in the winter, it's a nice place to hang out at because of the outside area.  The beer is a tad expensive but the jukebox is not bad.

Harvard Medical School says to eat more red meat if you want to be dead.  Implicitly, this means my new weight-loss goal should be somewhere between thin and dead, and since I tend to lean more toward thin, I'm going with dead.   And here's how. Someburros' crudo burrito, sans the tortilla. Order a side of crudo for $3.25, and if Harvard is right, you'll be dead in no time, this despite it's deliciously marinated beef smothered in spicy tomatillo sauce.  Yes, if South Beach and Atkins are good weight loss programs, you'll be in that banana hammock in less than a month, grossing-out all the girls poolside.  Well fuck you Harvard Medical.

I was trying to decide between the Breakfast Club, and my hotel was a lot closer to Good Egg.   Upon walking in, the cashier grabbed a menu quickly and lead me to my table. I was immediately seated and a waitress came over with a jug of water with lemon slices. I ordered a fresh large glass of orange juice. REALLY fresh and perfect flavor.   For breakfast, I ordered the Farmhouse benedict. It had sausage patty, bacon, and ham on a buttermilk biscuit with sausage gravy drizzled on top. Complimented by a side of potatoes. It looked delicious, but my food was near cold. The biscuit I could taste was not near warm, and it seemed like it was just put on the bottom straight from the fridge? The meats were good except the bacon. A little too crispy and chewy. Does that make sense? LOL I took the bacon off. I was definitely hungry and I didnt want to complain to the waitress so I ate it all. She was also very friendly and came by a couple times to make sure I enjoyed my meal, so thats why I didn't do anything about it.

I have made stops at such places as Old Chicago, Pizzeria Uno and various other pizza joints claiming to have Chicago style deep dish pizza.

Oregano's Pizza was FANTASTIC the other night, with an outstanding spinach, mushroom and sausage deep dish pizza topped with unbelievable service. We also tried a stuffed portobello mushroom dish which was just wonderful.  There are still a couple slices in my fridge that I continue to find myself staring at, seeking the right moment to have a secondary experience with this delicious food.

And so, I went on my own.  The Good... Hot dogs!! However you want it.. I know nothing about Chi-Town dogs, but I loved the pile of goodness that was on these, Friendly owners that were willing to direct me through the maze, and were even happier to discover that I enjoy exploration with food. I'm not a fan of the fries... the times I've had them they were sort of limp. And the tamales were plastic wrapped and quite bland and mushy... perhaps thats a Chicago thing I dunno, but I like good Tex-Mex Tamales, and these weren't even close to good. Much less as good. And as much less as I hate to say it, the Gyro's are a bland abomination of dull. Dont even try them, presliced, premeasured, microwaved, limp mediocrity. With such a great beef sandwich and such to be had, they should just take tamales and gyros off the menu... no reason to ruin such a great menu with these things, just remove em.  It's a specialty dog, steamed, and served with kindness and family love. Under a giant hot dog sign. And while in many ways I prefer Ted's grilled dogs, Higley has a definite place in my heart, and close to home.  So in closing, nothings perfect, but this place is simply awesome.

That doesn't bother me thought because I can just sit down at the bar and look around because it really is amazing to see the modern mixed in with some deliberately remaining fixtures of the past. The upper floor has a small bar(that I've never seen in use) a  few more intimate spaces to hang, a VERY confusing bathroom area (due to the mirrors and lighting-you're doomed if there's an emergency) and a balcony that opens to the floor below where the classy bar is smack dab in the middle. There is a dinning area surrounding two sides as well as some tables and high chairs on the other side.  There is a DJ perch opposite the balcony where pretty cool, chill tunes add to the loungey feel of this place. They have a good selection of beer and wine and according to my girl, ""The BEST Manhattan EVER!!!"" (served by Rene who had awesome glasses) What I really like about this place is that it's a great place to get a little dressed up and have some high quality adult beverages. Places like this are rare in Phoenix so if you feel like putting on something nicer than jeans and flip flops to enjoy a classy night out, I would recommend checking out Hanny's."|review|wNqwKWaRjClmcKsoJJRFow|3|0|2

There is also a mailbox on the corner -a convenience considering that the Laveen post office is a nightmare to get in and out of.  If you have visitors who are coming to town, take them to Mystery Castle (near South Mountain) and then drive them down to the Del Monte for an ice cream out of the cooler.  It's fun to see the local cowboys hitch their horse to the hitching post and walk in to get a cool drink - your friends will get a big kick out of the local folklore.

The wait was awesome. Best wait for a table at a restaurant I have ever had. The owners were also running around handing out hot dog pops. Little corn dogs on sticks some with Jalapeno cheese in them. It was a surprise as to which ones did. Also the nicest girl was handing out waters and refilling them for those standing around. She had the best attitude, I think, ever for someone filling up water glasses. As busy as it was she was super happy and excited to be refilling water. Plus she was genuinely happy that you had shown up. The owners were very nice too. Everyone was. So after my awesome time of waiting I finally got called. Felt like I won something. Got seated at a table with several other people in various stages of their meals. Again understandable with so many people. Waiter came over, also very nice, took drink orders. Nice girl with the water showed up again. The menu is changed slightly from the food truck menu. All the regular dogs are there and you can build your own. Plus they have new entrees and salads. You can also order pitchers of beer which is great and they have Kilt Lifter on tap another plus. Had a little trouble picking which dog I wanted. So many great choices. Finally got the Bear. Which has the oddest list of ingredients that you would think would not work at all but it just does. Peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked Gouda cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce. Crazy right? But soooo good. The fact that all of their dogs are served on naan bread pushes it over the top. Drinks took awhile coming out. Again no problem. I love the little tin trays they bring the food in. All dogs are served with chips or a garden salad. It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time and the hot dogs were really good too. This place is awesome. If you go here and just get a plain old mustard and sauerkraut dog you are doing yourself a disservice. Also don't miss out on Mamma Toledo's pie shop. Hidden in the corner. Turn left instead of right when you head towards the bathrooms. They will Shut Your Pie Hole. Didn't try the pies but the cookie bars were really good. If they are any indication the pies should be great. I had an awesome time. No one else can have as awesome of a time here as I did, it is impossible, but you will get a great hot dog though. The best around. Even if you have to wait for it trust me it is very worth it. There is a reason there is a wait. They are that good. Your mind might just be blown. It is possible.  This place has the possibility of becoming very special for me but that is just me. Only me. I don't want to build it up too much for everyone else.|review|MnDHJvePh4cWMrBgOp0_Ig|9|9|12

The patty is made to your liking (I like mine Medium). When you bite into the burger, you bite into a little bit of heaven. Make sure to add their ""secret"" Red Robin spice to the burger, it totally enhances the flavor. Although this gourmet burger place is a ""chain"", it definitely doesn't feel like a chain quality.  Along with their burgers, they offer free bottomless steak fries. They are fried to perfection and will fill you up quick.  Average price is about $8-10 for the burgers, but it includes the unlimited fries, so it's a pretty decent deal. Definitely bang for your buck if you come here.  Be sure to sign up for their e-club too as you get a free meal on your birthday!"|review|e9HWnHUYlt9758oileaISw|0|0|0

Very friendly, fun and helpful staff! They offered tons of samples and suggestions for mixing flavors to resemble candy bars, desserts, fruity drinks etc.  I tried out their chocolate hazelnut, tastes exactly like those Ferrero Rocher chocolates [Heaven]! We also tried their dark chocolate and coconut ~ put it in the same spoonful and you'll be in Almond Joy heaven - sans almond [with a lot less guilt] :) They even offer a glass of water while youre enjoying your gelato, really nice touch!|review|oguZELseKCGWBFUjjH4CqQ|2|1|3

Shouldn't those be reserved for such esteemed places like Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco? Eh, whatev.  The pizza here is delicious, they are way inexpensive, and you get very full, very quickly. The interior of this location is kinda dingy, but clean, so I don't mind sitting on the same booth that has been there since 1986 (or whenever the place opened).

There is an option to sit outside in a patio area between buildings, so it is fairly secluded and peaceful.

Ok, so I went with a large group and we ordered from the prix fixe menu ($39.95 for choice of apps/entrees/dessert). Some fried rice, beef & broc, orange peel chicken. All of it was extra salty. The fried rice: zero veggies, eggs only (extra $ btw for fried sted white rice). That too was salty. I have to say that this might be a regional faux pas? Anyway, one thing to ring home about was the lettuce wraps app. Very well, done, although it was hard to recognize the chicken in it. For dessert, the Great Wall chocolate cake wasn't too bad: not so moist, but good frosting. This was meh!! I'd hit up Panda...|review|Avu3BYcXE_97L1H2HLKL2g|0|0|0

I even forgot my wallet once and they just gave me the sandwich anyway, the owner said he didn't want me to waste my lunch hour driving back to the office to get it- I made it a point to go back the next day and pay for it.   They have the best wheat bread; thick and soft slices.  I am a turkey sandwich kind of girl and they never disappoint. Their bakery selections are just like grandma used to make.

It breaks my heart to write this review because back home Maggiano's was one of my favorite restaurants. I've always thought this place had good food and that the prices were fair for the huge portions, so I was super excited to find one here in Arizona. BUT this location sucked and i'm  sad that i won't be returning.   Right when we walked in, we were greeted by the manager who asked us how we were doing. My bf and I politely answer, then for a good 5 seconds there was complete silence. I look at him like dude, be normal and say ""just two?"" or ""how many?"" Instead he looks at me, makes this rude gesture with his head and has this look on his face like ""what do you want?"" So I'm like... ""uhhh.. table for two."" Anyways, I try to ignore his rudeness.. but me and my bf were like wow.. what's this guy's deal?   Anyways, after Mr. Incompetent seats us, the entire dining experience kept going down hill:  -Loss of 1 star: Dirty Dishes. I'm usually the kind of person who doesn't speak up when I'm unhappy with something at a restaurant, but as we were waiting for our food we noticed the small plates and the wine glasses were super dirty! I was pretty grossed out so I asked the waitress (without trying to be annoying) to take it off the table.  -Loss of 2 stars: Slow Service. I started to get really annoyed when it took forever to bring out our bread. I just drooled as I saw people who were seated after us munching away on their bread. We finally got the bread once our first entree came out which was ridiculous. They were also really slow with refilling our drinks. At one point, I just started chewing ice .  -Loss of 3 stars: Rude service. In addition to the dumb manager in the front, our waitress was a little biatch! My bf asked her if we could have more olive oil and balsamic vinegar and as he was speaking, she looked at him and walked away! Then she came back and said she would bring it out... as she walked away from our table the ladies sitting at the table next to us say ""well that was a nice eye roll"". I was like oh hell no, did she roll her eyes at us?! Then the ladies next to us started complaining about the service and said they had been waiting for their check for a while and they had no idea where their server was.   -Loss of 4 stars: Smaller Portions. I always get the same thing back home; a salad and a chicken and spinach manicotti. When the manicotti came out, I was shocked! It was a lot smaller than usual! I usually think the dish is worth the $15, but this definitely was not worth the money. It looked like it was missing a big chunk!! I was sooooooo sad!   It was just a bad experience overall. In all the times I have been to a Maggiano's, I have never left with such negative feelings! I guess I'll have to wait till I go back home to have my chicken manicotti again :("|review|XXVfsLunIiz3xDeK17aHFQ|1|1|3
iELA6eREUgDVQrtLgYmS6Q|2014-01-27|rsBrId8uA-Cfc_n-Q4H9mw|5|"This is so thoroughly the Platonic ideal of froyo that you will leave convinced that there is a Socratic dialogue called De Froites (""On Froyo"") in which Socrates disputes with a bevvy of sloe-eyed, honey-skinned young men about whether flavors such as bananas foster and black-sesame are best reserved for philosopher-kings, lest the masses be lured into decadence.  The pistachio froyo is straight up amazing: the perfect blend of sweet-tart, with the flavor of real pistachios. If you fondly remember Jell-O pistachio pudding from your childhood but have become appalled at how sweet and processed it now tastes to you as an adult, have the pistachio froyo. It is the distilled memory of pistachio dessert.  The topping bar is fine -- every place has roughly the same these days -- but the important thing is that this froyo has live cultures, so you can blame your digestive health needs for indulgence here.  Having seemingly sampled every other froyo purveyor in the neighborhood, I can now settle down to concentrate on Yogurtland's plethora of seasonal and unique flavors."|review|4DtBamDdmuYGozIHJN9cig|1|0|0
CSoURupWEyuyzkjMOExKPg|2012-08-20|gN9Pa0BZ9Ihx6PEca79Uuw|5|Went with a friend early on a Sat. (6pm) for dinner.  I'm glad we went a little early because the place filled up fast.  Wait staff/service:  Welcomed by a staff member actually opening the door for me (nice touch).  Promptly seated.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the wine list and menu.  The waitress was also perfect in her timing...checked in enough to make sure we were happy, but not too much as to make you feel rushed.  Food/Drinks:  My friend had the house Pinot Grigio and I had a Negroni Nuovo (these things could be dangerous...a great drink for a summer day).  We split Antipasti (bread & cheese...this was yummy, although the name could be improved) and Insalate (Italian...also a boring menu name, but was tasty as well).  We both had pasta for our main course...Tagliatelle and Ricotta Gnocchi.  Both of us thought the pasta was delicious...perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  Dessert:  We split the Salted Carmel Budino.  It was so good, I almost ordered one to go.  Rich as Budino should be, but light enough so as not to put you in an after dinner coma.  Price:  If you want to try the traditional multi-course Italian meal, the prices can add up.  Our meal for 2 came to ~$110 (including 1 drink each and the tip).  For a casual dining atmosphere, some may consider this too pricey.  Other comments:  I read other comments about a problem with flies.  This must have been overcome, because we didn't notice any.  This is a restaurant I will visit again to sample some of the other menu items.|review|D7H7T-Q_Y8FJI5li8ZYaiw|0|0|0

After hearing a number of conference attendees raving about the treatments they received at Jurlique, I was looking forward to getting in for a massage. I was scheduled at the end of the day, so I was a bit apprehensive about what the quality would be like - you know how the end of a workday can be. Was I silly to be worried! Jurlique is tucked into an building on the corner of the Firesky lot. It's got a small waiting area stocked with the typical spa goods and a few seats. An okay place for a short wait, and Enna, the front office clerk, was very welcoming. When Kayleen came out to introduce herself as my therapist, I was a bit nervous. I'm used to getting worked on by sturdy Samoan gals, not tall willowy blondes. But my nerves were soothed the instant Kayleen the Massage Ninja plied her trade. I couldn't put my finger on what she was doing that was not only relaxing me but loosening me up until I asked Kayleen about her techniques. She combines massage with acupressure, and it works wonders!  Based on the experiences of our conference attendees, I'd say anyone at Jurlique can  deliver a great massage. Based on my experience, I can say that Jurlique should do whatever they can to keep Kayleen on staff!|review|JZAhu8YpzgaCtWi_pW7P1Q|0|0|0

For starters the prices are no where near the full dinner items so it really makes it affordable to just pop in and see what this amazing place has to offer.    The drink list is huge and again very affordable.  I recommend the mojito very good and just the right mix of tart and freshness.    For light bites I had the Duck Pate with wine mustard which was very good.  It had some nice earthy flavor that the wine mustard really played well with.  I then got the steak tartar which was just phenomenal.  It had a little kick to it and the steak just melted in your mouth and absorbed all the richness of the quail egg.

Right off the bat one of the girls working here told my friends that she wanted his balls in her mouth and she wasn't joking. I was disgusted by her behavior. After that  we met a guy on the patio who found a puppy in the bar and was trying to comfort the dog because it was scared of all the people and loud music. Later on that evening a bouncer told me that the dog belonged to the owner of Shotgun Betty's and was looking for the guy who was holding the puppy. I told him that the guy who had the puppy was concerned for its well being because he heard someone was making the dog lick drugs in the bathroom. I couldn't believe the owner would bring a puppy to the bar and leave it unattended.

Why not just take names like every other restaurant and seat people as the table opens up? My thought is that you're standing in line right next to the display cases the whole time, when it's your turn to order, you've been eying that slice of cake, scone, or other baked dessert for so long that you have no choice but to order it. Will power won out this time - no scone for me!  The food was decent and the service was also pretty good. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich, being more in the average category than extraordinary, I don't think I would get it again. Having to serve my own drink from the fountain, waiting in line for so long to just make our order, getting taunted by all the baked goods, the general chaos of the place, and me personally living so far away (in downtown PHX), I can honestly say I'm not going to be making this a destination for dining. If you're close by and it's not a weekend, I imagine this spot is a lot less hectic and easier to deal with.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. See you on Yelp!|review|cRyNICH0mhjxagvSyVr60Q|4|3|11

Well cancel your flight to NYC for the Smithsonian because believe it or not, we have some cultural options right here in the desert's playground.   I went to the Heard Museum many a day when I was a little girl visiting Phoenix (a much less populated city at the time). From the crafts to the history, the Heard Museum entertained even an 8 year old who really just wanted to play in the pool all day long. Fast forward a ""couple"" of years and I decided it was time to give this historical haven the grownup test. My friends, I was more than impressed. You know how sometimes you visit someplace as a kid and then you go back as an adult and everything seems smaller and just cheaper looking? Don't worry about this being the case with the Heard Museum. They have done a fabulous job of keeping the museum up-to-date, clean and full of great ways for all ages to learn about the Native American culture in Arizona.   Some highlights include:  1. Interactive. The Heard created great displays with information and an interactive game for children...or children at heart.   2. Visual dessert for the eyes. They don't cheat you on historical artifact exhibits which shows that they have a nice group of donors who are eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating.   3. Family-fun for everyone. I saw a brochure marketing family-fun days every Saturday in July. Activities include, interactive games, crafts, live performances, etc.   4. AZ Resident Friendly. The admission price was $12 and I cringed a little, but then as if I was meant to get a little cultured that day, they told me that AZ residents receive free admission every second Sunday of the month. Not a bad way to take care of the residents melting in the heat!   5. Cafe food you actually want to eat. To make the most of the day, I ate at the cafe and took advantage of the 85 degree weather while it still lasted. The food...was good. I had a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad. Just writing that down made me hungry and want to go back for more.   So now that I've spread the good word on the Heard, it's time to check it out for yourself."|review|4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ|6|2|6

The service here is really very good.  But here's the problem:  The food is just average and the margaritas are not very good - but they are OK.  Even so... prices here are pretty high - and always have been - so I can't blame the prices on rising food costs.  For example, the house margarita is $9, the Queso Laredo (yellow velveeta-like cheese dip with 1 spoon of ground meat on top) tastes like cheese dip from a jar and it's $12 and the guacamole is $10...  The beef fajitas are almost flavorless... Margarita prices are a little better at Happy Hour - and there is a small ""tapas"" menu...  We do end up going back for the service and the convenient location... and every time we leave just a little more disappointed in the margaritas and food.   This chain is missing something - maybe it could start with a better house margarita recipe.   I really do want to like the place... it is so convenient... but the food doesn't have any flavor.  This is the Denny's of ""gourmet"" Mexican food.    I've been to Cantina Loredo in Dallas - and the Dallas Airport, too.  The food and margaritas are all the same at all location - and so are the prices.  Very corporate.  Very consistent.   Just something missing...   So, if you happen to be in Gilbert, AZ, and or just passing through - then Casa Laredo is a convenient, ""safe"",  very run of the mill Mexican food chain restaurant experience at the local mall with really good custoemr service."|review|Ad7xAVWtkcB2dR6tLHQSsA|0|0|1
oHjoahzL5F0m-OGDQouEGw|2008-12-10|dfXRJU-dFGwQfIGgi3f4vQ|4|The Trailhead Bike Shop and Cafe is a new bike shop and cafe born from the efforts of local Kiel Marley. The concept is pretty simple: have bike shop add cafe and let the results happen. The execution is going well so far. The location is on 16th St and Glendale in the Basha's shopping center on the SE corner, so its easy to find and get to. It also sits right on the canal route that is paved from the Biltmore to 75th Ave so you can stop in while cruising all over town.  When you immediately walk into the shop you are in the bike shop part of things. Its a pretty traditional setup of new bikes all lined up and shiny. They seem to be a Felt shop which is cool. If you need a new bike this is a good place to go.  The food is simple and good. Pastries are coming from a local bakery and are very good. They make the Quiche in-house and it was very filling. I also had a Latte and Kathryn had a Hot Chocolate which went down well on a chilly December morning ride.  Overall I will be back to the Bike Cafe and recommend that you stop by soon!|review|N1koTSTyiLCD8zH0rHSh4w|3|2|5

EGiGWZp_zSqdeftiFQ7MbA|2007-05-29|CO_CNwby7N2sA6k3zTAkpw|4|"Now that I've dined at Cantina Laredo a handful of times, I'd say it's the place I'd recommend for people looking for a ""nicer"" Mexican restaurant. The best way I can describe it is to say that it ""fits"" in North Scottsdale. Although Cantina Laredo is not (as of yet) a chain restaurant, it definitely has the polished, upscale, corporate feel of let's say, for example, Cheesecake Factory... but it's quality Mexican food.  Every time I've ended up at Cantina Laredo it's been lunch... as odd as that happens to be for me. On one hand, this means I've had the benefit of lunch portions and lunch prices... on the other hand, it means I've never seen the diner menu (I'm assuming the short menu I have seen with the low prices was for lunch only). As of writing this review, there are many excellent two item lunch combos for $7.99.  As with most Mexican resturants, the meal began with tortilla chips and two kinds of salsa... only this time when they said one of the salsas was ""hot"" they actually meant temperature. They were equally spicy, but one was served warm. The flavors of the salsa varied greatly, which was appreciated.  The first time I dined, I had two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans (of which you get a choice between three varieties). I was nervous when the plate came to the table because it looked like they were drowning in red sauce, but they turned out to be excellent. The cheese managed to keep a great deal of flavor and the sauce turned out to be thicker than it first appeared.  Today for lunch, I had a cheese enchilada and beef taco combo. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the beef was what many other lesser Mexican restaurants would describe as ""steak"" although it also felt a little drier than I would've liked it. I still managed to ""clean my plate"", hence the positive review. My dining companion had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was very pleased as well.  This brings us to the desert tray. I did not have room for desert at the end of my meal... in fact, I ate waaaaay too much, but I passed the tray on the way to my booth (it's very strategically located so you see it before you start your meal). With the caveat that this is totally hearsay, I have it on ""good authority"" that the double chocolate cake is nothing short of amazing. Next time I go I think I'm going to leave room for either that or the flan."|review|1RzVTIr6nxAwPV7RB7-U0Q|1|0|1
j7n42b5qDMJR68q3Dv9u6A|2009-06-17|yN9tL9CURiKRwwrU4SRlfA|4|"La Mirage Mediterranean occupies a wierd pad in NoPho's Bell Canyon Pavillions Shoppping Center, at I-17 north of Bell -- the room's kind of shaped like a big wedge of cheese.  But it's fresh and tidy inside, with twangy M.E. music and an owner-looking guy with slicked back hair sitting in a back office while a couple of women were out front serving customers.    Compared with other M.E. places I've been, the food was really good, but a good , tasty, quality stand-ard, not stand-out.  Considering that other nearby choices start with ""Native New..."",   ""Hometown..."",   ""Apple..."",   ""Hoot..."", et al., this is really a great option to have available.  I also had the Lunch Special::: sammie, side, and drink for $5.99.  You choose any pita-wrapped sandwich, from among about a dozen different meaty or veggie selections, including chicken or beef shawarma, tika, kabob, falafel, hummous, etc.  You can have a soup, house salad or fries, or for a $buck extra get a Tabhouli Salad, that I found really tasty, lemony and not too oily, larger than expected, with lots of tomato bits mixed in, and bulgar wheat bits that were closer to soggy grape nuts than chewy couscous.  After a few initial weird bites, I eventually decided the texture was really nice, and I'm a fan of it now, over the more common pasta-y bits.  Mixed it into my Falafel sandwich, which was really good, but not the best I've had, just really good (there will never be another *ORIGINAL* Yusef's, which is my gold standard, well, really they were green!)  They have a stage and do entertainment here as well, with a website to consult for special event dates.  I've driven past this place pretty late on a Saturday and seen it hopping.   For some reason they have a DJ'd Latin Dance night once a week, I think every Tuesday.(?!?)   Overall really nice place I'll be back to, for sure.  Maybe not for the live music, but mos def for the awesome Lunch Special."|review|n_lAaNGeWgspbbCJc0DqRg|5|4|7

But the food is great and the drinks are awesome. They have this yummy melon drink with gummy bears or  gummy worms, but anyway it is really good. My favorite dishes are the lamb chops with pesto and the Lamb Kisra my 11 year old loves their burgers and sweet potato fries. Their Spicy fries are also good they pair them with this yummy garlic mayo dipping sauce Mmmm.  But by far my very favorite thing is to go on a Saturday and Sunday for brunch OMG their brunch is truly the best. Fez has GREAT Fez Benedict (eggs Benedict) this is one the of few places you can still get great eggs Benedict. They also make yummy French toast and this awesome breakfast pasta. I must say when I first saw the breakfast pasta on the menu I thought it was weird but it is truly delicious so much so that I took my boyfriend to try it and he had to try and make it at home. Fez is a must try the service has not always been the best it really depends on the server but they always look Fab and the decor is really cool. Fez Is a place that you want to go to when you are not in a rush, it's a place to take your time and enjoy.  It is also a hot spot for drinks so once the sun goes down the music goes up and the drinks flow Woohoo let the good times Roll :)|review|nxHfcFGkhKkqhvuf5QEcMw|1|1|1

I've had to do multiple money orders/card replacements/account opening/account merging operations here and never had any problems. The previous two reviews call out issues that have nothing to do with this branch, so I'm a bit perplexed as to why they are trying to ding the business. (Fraud claims go through a centralized customer service center via phone, and insects live everywhere & sadly infiltrate even the best business regardless of efforts to prevent it)  This location has a very attentive and consistent staff. I've been visiting them for years, and see the same friendly faces regularly. I appreciate that, and I think it shows well. If a company takes care of their staff, they're more likely to take care of customers in my opinion and experience.

Babe Ruth was reported to have once ate 12 hot dogs & 8 bottles of soda between games of a double header. He was rushed to the hospital after the game.  What a surprise, right?    Al Capone's favorite food was???  Anyone?  Bueller?   Nathan's Coney Island!  What no Vienna Beef?  Today, Chicago's O'Hare sells more than 2 million hot dogs a year.  Now I am sure these dogs are Vienna Beef!  I bring this up, because about a year ago SONIC decided to broaden their hot dog menu, with four new dogs: All American, Coney Island, Chicago and New York.  This year they've added a 1/4 pound Footlong to their lineup of Tube Steaks.  http://www.sonicdrivein.com/MenuSection/coneys-hot-dogs  Admitted, I haven't been an SONIC aficionado up until now.  But, a ""shout out"" to my friend Jennifer W and her family, who must be considered the unofficial Queen of SONIC!  How do you stay so thin?  I was willing to give their new menu items a try.  First the bad news, these aren't Nathan's Famous, Hebrew National, or Vienna Beef.  They aren't even Oscar Mayer!  But, for $3.99 for a 1/4 pound footlong hot dog and Tater Tots, they're not bad.  And, a lot better than Der Wienerschnitzel!  BTW, the  World Record for hot dog eating is 68 set by Joey Chestnut at Nathan's Famous in Coney Island.  It was reputed that former Champ, Takeru Kobayashi ate 69 at a nearby location.  Ugh!~"|review|1BW2HC851fJKPfJeQxjkTA|20|24|24

The seaweed wasn't old and tough like someplaces' around the Valley. I was impressed by the variety of choices in sushi rolls they had on the menu.

Inside did seem rather tiny though.   Had the absolutely delightful Shrimp Tacos...totally addicting (actually craving them now but we live 60 or so miles away).  Anyhow, the 3 corn tortilla tacos had one large shrimp that had a light, crispy breading with shredded cabbage and a delicious sauce...just yummy!  Almost everyone ordered the Shrimp Tacos while we were there. Hubby had the HUGE breakfast burrito...which he loved but had a hard time finishing..and he usually finishes everything. Believe me it's huge!! Margarita not very good but the Red Wine Sangria was wonderful! Light and refreshing. Chips and salsa (which you have to purchase) were really good...chips were homemade and the salsa was very fresh with just the right amount of heat for me. Had a Chocolate Whiskey cake for dessert...very rich and very chocolatey..not great but good!!   Prices are great. Had two alcoholic beverages, one iced tea, two entrees, chips and salsa and one dessert for about $45. Menu at lunch seemed rather limited but sooooooo good. Will definitely go again for dinner hoping there is more on the menu. Actually I really want the Shrimp Tacos again... :)  Enjoy!!|review|m7XyiDBr2SyTjltHcTizrg|0|0|1

The wine section is amongst the best you will ever see and surpasses both selection and quality of many wine specialty stores. A wide variety of ethnic specialty items makes every trip to AJ's like an exploration of foreign cuisine possibilities and the pricing is not too high to discourage experimentation.  Overall, I highly recommend AJ's from all perspectives; Food quality, selection, pricing and service.  yes, AJ's is slightly more expensive than Safeway, but makes up for this disparity with quality and service.|review|4HVJGaN2l3i-yk1cdoq4QQ|0|0|3

Mind you it's still under construction and I was prepared to be disappointed.....I arrived and was greeted with a smile, told happy birthday before I could even say why I was there...and given the keys to raid the mini bar because I signed up ahead of time as a kimpton member.  We went to the pool and the bartender made me a green cucumber drink that was so refreshing and the pool was the perfect temp...in AZ that is hard to achieve in late July.there were beach balls and the pool chairs had Terri cloth lining.it was really relaxing but fun when needed.    When I got back to the room there was champagne and chocolate covered strawberries and a chocolate happy birthday sign.  There were two XL smart waters and I knew this birthday was about to be epic.   We invited some friends to meet up at the blue hound bar area and there was Free happy hour going on.  We moved into the bar and then ordered the devolved eggs, the potatoes w aioli and flatbreads, the jalapeños ....everything was amazing and each dish outdid the other.   The thing that really put the WOW in my stay and prompted my review was the personal thank you card I was handed by the waitress before we left to go to the concert. It was signed by the entire crew at blue hound wishing me fun on my birthday, thanking me for spending it with them and personal messages to wish me fun at the Bruno Mars concert.  Are you kidding me? WOW!!!!!!!!!! Thanks to this stay I will be making every stay at a Kimpton hotel from now on. Well done!

They lose 2 stars on the simple fact that for the past 5 times I've been there they f*** my order up. And what the f*** up isn't even a huge deal so I just can't wrap my head around why it keeps happening.   I always order the Sapporo ramen. It's SUPPOSED TO come with butter and corn in it already. And then I just add all the extras to it. It's there, on the menu, clear as day that the Sapporo ramen SPECIFICALLY comes with butter and corn. So when I place my order I ask for the Sapporo ramen, add egg and naruto. EACH AND EVERY time I get my order and all the extras I asked for are in there...but no butter or corn. Who the hell is working back there in the kitchen to get it wrong EVERY...SINGLE...TIME?!?! Not every now and again...but EVERY SINGLE TIME...  I can bet you $50 right now...that I'll walk in there, order it...and it will be wrong. I can 1000% guarantee it will be wrong.  I know what a lot of people are saying...""What's the big deal? Just ask for butter and corn..."" Which, yeah sure...I would (actually I have to anyway since they won't give it to me to begin with)... But why should I HAVE to ask for something to be added to a soup that THEY put on the menu saying should already be in there?!?!? What ever happened to quality control??? Or can I safely assume that no one just gives a f***?  Here's an idea...just take it off the menu. You can't seem to get it right away...so save me the trouble of having to get angry about it later and just remove it off the menu."|review|MQHmGQCCvvQ2EobcM4Qhlw|0|2|1

I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.  Starving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask.|review|N-D-d1Z4UybdlkK1HxlNPA|2|1|4

Empty chip and salsa bowls as well as empty water glasses were moved to the edge of the table for obviousness, but we still had to ask for refills.  Food was tasty, but WAY over-salted.    Wife's Pina' Colada was watered down (she rarely drinks and she noticed it).  Overall, a very so-so experience.  I'll take my $40 to Rubio's for a better experience next time without the sodium poisoning and save $30!|review|IW7EiO19FSnD5CUk5Jpk5w|0|0|1

The food is very good and way beyond 'buffet' quality. 2. So many dishes. Around 10 cold dishes and around 50 hot dishes plus fruits, salad, desserts, sushi station and Mongolian grill.  They even had frog legs, duck, crab (not legs though) and mussels. I was overwhelmed and ate too much. 3. Clean and the food is fresh. Salmon and cod tasted like they cooked fresh ones, not frozen ones. 4. The people working there are nice and friendly.  My husband and I went there for Sunday lunch and our bill was around $31 including tea and a coke.   Sushi was okay, better than buffet quality, but not as good as ones you get at sushi restaurants as the fish was not so fresh. But I like the made to order idea.  The receipt says we can get $5 discount next time within 30 days. So we will definitely go back to this place in a month.|review|ACGwyyg3Z05jxZOmkadaJA|0|0|0

My boyfriend and I stopped by one Sunday morning for some breakfast.  Everything on the expansive menu sounded delicious.  JJ's serves breakfast  (skillets, eggs, pancakes, french toast, omelettes, pastries, etc), lunch and other savory deli items (knish, challah...).   Place your order at the counter, grab some coffee and find a seat inside or on the patio.  I ordered an egg white Greek omelette with fresh fruit and a whole wheat bagel (the options included potatoes or fruit and bagel or toast).  My honey had two eggs with fruit and a side of buttermilk pancakes.   Our food arrived within minutes of finding a spot on the patio.  What impressed me most about JJ's is the quality of the food.  When ordering an egg white omelette you'd expect less eggs and more veggies than your typical ""whole-egg"" omelette.  Not so at JJ's.  The veggies were fresh and the egg whites were plentiful.  I finally found a place that caters to my health-nut tendencies without skimping on quantity or flavor.  Did I mention the buttermilk pancakes are phenomenal?  JJ himself was helping customers, busing tables and even moving in heating lamps for the chilly patron.  It was nice to have our needs met by the owner himself.  Amazing food, service and down-to-earth atmosphere.  I will be back!"|review|qZrArI2ohkYkQlELl13BKQ|6|6|7

Yes, the pizza is pre-made and on display under glass on the counter (9-10 different varieties at lunch) but they give it a couple of minutes in the oven before they serve it to you.  The key to this place I think is to get there when they open or after they start making their dinner pizzas.  Fresh and hot is best.  I really like this place.  Its simple, good and the value is pretty decent for the size of the slice.  I really enjoy any of their pesto pizzas and greek pizzas.  Very good.|review|LT3L8-tthzD0IakgXm81pw|1|1|1

xI0UZH734lJtm39DbLf-Bw|2011-07-27|_pbIKHXhPaAbO9YFIdsZiA|1|My boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers. We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it. Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well, aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced, the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two. Also no waters were given to us until requested. I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good, until I started actually eating it, the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage, gross. The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure, the bill came and $1.99 for sour cream, and $2.50 for guacamole.... Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff. Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip, I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before. I do not recommend this place to ANYONE, unless you're just going for drinks and some chips and salsa other than that avoid this place entirely if you enjoy good service, friendly atmosphere, and good food.|review|y5yAdGSOFlcxPmqfsS9HPQ|0|1|1

One that you wouldn't change any part of, and that leaves you with a goofy little satisfied grin?   I just had one of those. Thanks, Chef Chu.   The atmosphere of the place is very sleek without being uppity. It's a little dark, so if you have trouble seeing in low light, be warned. It's a comfortable spot, but I imagine that it gets pretty packed on the weekends.   The drink menu is overwhelming- multiple pages each of sake, vodkas, martinis, and a small wine list. I don't know enough about sake to know what the heck anything is, but I do know a good martini when I see one. The Pink Ginger was the perfect blend of cranberry, ginger infused vodka, muddled ginger, and lime. It wasn't  nearly as sweet as it sounds, and it went down almost too easily. Watching Tim order the Spicy Mama with a straight face was amusing, but unfortunately the Thai chili infused vodka lacked the burn he was going for.   We ordered Citron Tofu, Red Curry Chicken wings, ginger fish, Thai basil clams, and the sugar cane pork.   Tofu- 5 stars. One of my favorite things about Chu's previous restaurant, Fate, was the tofu. He does it right and like no one else.   Curry chicken wings- 5 stars. I love Thai curry, and these were a great interpretation of an American favorite. Yum.   Ginger Fish- I'd give this one ten stars if I could. It was by far my favorite part of the meal. The fish was cooked to perfection, and the dipping sauce was full of flavor and the perfect amount of spice. I have no idea what was in the sauce, but I loved it.   Clams- I didn't like the clams at all, but Tim thought they were brilliant. Having never had clams before, I was put off more by the gritty texture than the taste. The broth that they clams are served in is quite tasty with a pleasant burn.   Sugar Cane pork- 4 stars. Ground pork wrapped around sugar cane, deep fried, and served with a pineapple ginger sauce. Tasty, but quite rich. I think I'd only order this one again if there were more than two people sharing it, because one piece is enough. (An order is 4 pieces)   All in all, a great meal. Sens definitely isn't an every day eat-out spot, as it can get expensive pretty fast, but it's one for regular rotation.|review|N7lSh49zQ13sG3Jpa9E6cw|2|2|3

They recently remodeled it, so now it carries groceries as well as the normal retail section.   I have to say that this store has the worst customer service I have ever seen. The employees are not interested in helping customers. They seem to only be focused on stocking the shelves and going home to their lives.   While the prices are fantastic, it is always difficult to find what you are looking for, because they keep changing where everything is located.   Also when it finally comes time to check out, you should be prepared to wait for at least 10-15 minutes, even if you only have one item.  Overall, it could be a lot better. However the store is pretty clean and you still go home with what you were expecting.|review|xcZz_YXKG9hEC5D7MT9sRA|0|0|1

This was my first time there - went for the omakase - Roka has two choices - a $98 which is composed of ""the most premium ingredients"" and a $128  ""comprised of rare and hand selected ingredients.""   I ordered the $128 menu.    Perhaps I am more of a ""foodie"" then I thought, or it was the chef's choices, but I was pretty bored with the dishes that were sent out, as I've had most of it before.  Ponzu sauce and truffle oil were on most of the dishes. The yellowtail sashimi and oyster both had a bad aftertaste. Requested some ginger to cleanse the pallet.  Squash blossom tempura wasn't anything to write home about.  Steamed mussels are well, steamed mussels.   Also on the menu were the beef tataki, which was good, black cod, domestic wagyu beef (a little gamey),  grilled asparagus and zucchini, and a wild mushroom hot pot (somewhat interesting).  The only dish that I hadn't had before was a Japanese pepper that had been grilled - which was pretty good also included was a a toro flight which I enjoyed.  For desert, passion fruit and a berry sorbet, panecotta, and fruit ie. cantelope, grapefruit, pear, mango, some berries.  Desert was definitely a dud.  Overall, expected more - the taste of the food was okay.  For what I recieved, this place fell flat.  This is not even considering the price.  Including the price into the equation, definitely thought it was overpriced and not worth it."|review|UFvCKo6vi5yudcJGF9uEug|0|0|1

Phoenix has surprisingly good sushi restaurants and Kyoto is one of them. It's not NY nor LA but...  My biggest beef(or tuna) with Kyoto is their lack of sympathy for people with service animal. They DO NOT allow service animals in their restaurant.  We have two Yorkies and they are our service  dogs.  We have never been denied access to a restaurant before. This is not very AMERICAN.

However in my world, football and beers go together like peas and carrots so when I can't get a beer, I get sad....and a little mad. We couldn't get the attention of our server for the life of us, not sure if she was just ditsy or in the weeds, but she was basically non existent the whole time.   The crowd was really funky for it being Scottsdale: a few normal people, a man dressed like a pirate and your standard douchey people dressed up to watch football on the patio in 100+ degree weather.

xWnS17JRqB2Cjdgfncnnng|2013-12-31|SHx62YH9uBryt_9eFHYHNw|5|So there is this amazing pizza place called Pizza Press outside of Disneyland. It is one of my must haves when I visit.   Imagine my joy when I walked into Fired Pie with the same concept and deliciousness but without the almost 400 mile drive!  The toppings are fresh and choices are plentiful so even the picky eater can find something. The reg tomato pizza sauce isnt spicy and it isn't sweet ( if I want sweet I will buy dessert!!). The only thing is to tell them is to not over cook the pizza cuz it can easily get charred.   If you arent a pizza person or need more than just pizza, the salads aren't to be missed. I ordered just a plain ceasar salad and it was awesome!  The lettuce was crisp and fresh. They didn't overpower it with either cheese or dressing. It wasn't premade and dumped in a bowl or packaging to just serve up. Another plus is that it is definitely big enough to share if you are with someone and you are each having a pizza.  All said and done, this is a place that I hope stays in the neighborhood for years to come!|review|WL19ME-YE3I88LWk3prwbw|0|0|1

I have ate here around 7-8 and the sushi is always good, the saki bombs w/ kirin or sapporo hits the spot. You can be a little loud without having to worry about being jerks and the stir fry is tasty. While my favorite sushi is actually a chain called Yogi's(eel is epic) it does not really invite you to dine in with it's cafeteria seating so this place is my choice if I want to dine in. I haven't ventured too far on sushi trials but this place has better sushi than the following in my opinion.  Hana Sushi 101 Stingrays RA Ichi Ban Japanese Restaurant & Sushi on Central and thomas(nothing alike)  Service 5/5 always friendly and prompt food 3/5 sometimes its great sometimes its ok so it all depends sushi 4/5 rock solid and they have deals for half off if you order five so its a real bargain. drinks 4/5 nice sake and beer but the mixed drinks are just ok  Downside it they open only at night so I rarely get a chance to drive out to Mesa on a weekend as I run around much earlier most weekends.|review|9g_ARKx0eJmNH8oO1TR9rQ|0|0|1

0WI0ydH2HtFxFswYXhE--w|2012-03-11|T9bgLR2Xfh0_anWqgF0JDA|2|Today was the fourth time we have eaten there. And seems as though that each time we go, the ratings go lower and lower. The first time we ate there, it was at lunch hour on a weekday. We sat at the sushi bar and the owner and sushi chef was there to serve us. I have to admit, the way he cuts his fish is bigger than all the sushi places I have been (that includes NV, CO, WA, NM, CA, HI, Okinawa, Korea, and other sushi places in AZ). He was friendly and told us to come back for their happy hour the next time we were in that area. So, for the first time we ate there, I would give it a 5 star rating. We went back a second time, this time for dinner at around 7 p.m. It was packed lightly and yet the service seemed slow. Sushi was good, soft shell crab was not cooked too well. And, to top it off, they ran out of the yellow tail collar. SO, okay, four stars for that meal. Third time was dinner again at around 6 p.m. Again, the service was slow, but the sushi was good. 3 star rating. Today, Saturday, we went before 5 p.m. to try the happy hour. Although there weren't many customers yet, the service again was slow. I told my family, if in two minutes (after waiting for 5 minutes) no one shows up to ask us for our drink order, we were leaving. Thank goodness somebody showed up. Then, we ordered our food: soft shell crab, tempura appetizer, crunchy roll, spicy tuna roll, yellow tail, albacore, salmon and tamago for our son. Once again, the soft shell crab was a big disappointment, the tempura was not good, but the sushi again was good. We get our check, and 10 minutes later, no one has picked up our payment so I got up and handed it to another server. Today, I give it a two star rating. It seems like the place is self destructing each and every time we eat there. Never again will we go back to Nakama. We went back there the second time because our first experience was great. We went there a third and fourth time so that we can confirm that that is one place we will never spend money on ever again.|review|AiZ8p7WtLjJjCImr1i1EDQ|2|1|2

-NOet8xJLGhX-eUzSIDc2Q|2011-12-18|GpEWhPGPqdbT5X-ZkOp7qA|5|I simply don't understand some of these reviews below. People are knocking the place because they steam their meat instead roasting/braising it? C'mon. So you can't handle something different or what?  So for this review, I'm comparing it to Subway and Quiznos.  First off, Subway and Quiznos build the sub right there in front of you. At Firehouse, this is not so much the case - you order at the register and then the workers prepare it. For this reason, your sub will take slightly longer to make than either of those places and this is mainly because of how they cook the meat.  Now to the complainers saying that the meat is soggy or whatever, I've never had this experience. And, besides that, not all subs are cooked the same at Firehouse. Maybe before discarding the place, try more of the menu? That is just me though! I've tried many of the subs - Firehouse Meatball, New York Steamer, Italian, Club on a Sub, and the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket. My favorites, in order, are Italian, Steamer, and Beef & Cheddar. On a slightly odd note, the Italian makes *great* leftovers if you can't finish it.  Nobody really seems to have mentioned this... but the soda machine is freaking awesome. I don't know how many flavors it has, but it is pretty much the craziest thing you will ever see. It has a touch screen where you scroll through and select your flavor. And when I say select your flavor I mean if you want a Lemonade.... do you want it to be lemonade, raspberry lemonade, lime lemonade, or strawberry lemonade. It is nearly the same for every beverage selection you make.  I definitely prefer Firehouse over Subway or Quiznos. Sure, they may be a little more pricey, but I still like it. I will have to check out Jimmy John's, which everyone seems to rave about to see what all the fuss is about and round out my review for all 4 places.|review|y7sq26EXGz7XG7DSo8TOuQ|3|1|2

The entire valve in the wall needed to be replaced. I called several larger plumbing services, and a few other contractors, but Artie was the one we selected.  I called him, he came over that afternoon, and gave us a free estimate. His estimate wasn't over the top, and was quite a bit better than another competitor. As soon as he showed up at the house, you could tell he was a professional. He put shoe covers on before he came in the house. He talked me through what we needed to do, and he got it done. He is the type of plumber you want to work with. There are so many ""shady"" people out there, it's nice to know people care about their customers. Artie does.  There is no doubt in my mind. If we ever have any other plumbing issues, I'll be calling Artie. He's our go to guy. I would highly recommend him to anyone!!"|review|qc5jVT0iJSAV7ptg2wCiXw|0|0|1

The maintenance crew works really hard to quickly get repairs completed. The gym and pool are also nice features. I must say that I would like this place much better if there were at least two pools. The kids TAKE OVER the pool here and it's not so fun for those of us not ready to have yelling and screaming kids running around their life. I wish there was a kiddie pool or at least more than one pool so you could choose one or the other. The parking lot is also somewhat cramped, it seems pretty narrow for larger vehicles- trucks, Uhauls, campers, etc. Also the painting crew has taken up like 7 of the empty spots for the last few months. It just makes it all that much more difficult to find a parking spot. Like I said I like living here, but if anything these are a few suggestions that I could offer for a better living experience. Thanks!|review|H_JsAwjiGEOr_RlZmwfNsA|1|0|0

Imagine a salad bar but with raw Asian food ingredient with  cook at the end. One big pro about this style is that you can get just what you want. I for example do not eat meat. YC's allows me to cram as many veggies, noodles and tofu into a bowl as humanly possible. For me it has become a game, how many bowls can I fill post cooking. My current record is three. I can give you bowl construction tips if you would like. If it is not in the bowl it will not be cooked.  The sauces play a big role in the flavor of your meal. If you ask they will let you take a separate bowl for sauce and even help you mix. I like to make my own with generous amounts of garlic and hunan sauce. If you do like garlic like I do be sure to ladle garlic from the bottom of the container as that is where the real pieces are.   After you leave the cooking line you can augment your food with fried won ton strips, spicy oils, mustard's, peanuts, fresh cilantro, sesame seeds, pineapple and more. There also is a station with rice and soups for those who require more than just a bowl of Asian goodness. Soda is included with the meal price and for dinner so is access to the frozen yogurt machine.   If you can not finish your meal they will gladly sell you to go boxes at .50 a piece.    The one thing that confuses me is the name, Mongolians are a nomadic people, yet their BBQ grills are huge I don't see how that would work.|review|M6oU3OBf_E6gqlfkLGlStQ|1|2|2

Rico, B's husband has moved from Z Tejas to the Herb Box so I got to tag along to the ""practice night"", I'm sure there's technical term for if for those in the business but for me it meant free dinner at one of my favorite places.   First, the decor. You can't work in interior design for six years and not notice design. They've done it up in a cozy Cape Cod feel with exposed beams, wide plank floors, lots of blue and sea colors. Not so much you feel like you're in a sea food restaurant, but in a chic way. It has a little bit of a contemporary feel and the bathrooms are very cool. Check out the sinks. Go on. You need to go just for that.   B and I got there first, another friend was meeting us but was running a little late so we started with the cilantro crab dip, one of my favorites. There are nice, big chunks of crab in it and the plantain chips it comes with are thin, crisp and salty. For the main course B decided on the goat cheese chicken and enjoyed it. Our other friend got her old standby the Market Sunflower Salad and added salmon. I debated between the trout and the short ribs and ultimately decided on the short ribs but think next time I'll go with the trout. I have to say the short ribs were the second best I've had, in line right behind Chelsea's Kitchens. For dessert our waiter brought us a slice of the stout cake with espresso frosting, pure heaven, and a piece of the blackberry bread pudding. The bread pudding was more like a steamed dumpling and was lacking in flavor though the creme anglais it came with was creamy and unctuous. The espresso frosting on the cake reminded me of penuche candy.  I wasn't too excited to get a piece of cake but it really was a nice treat.  I just ate the frosting off the back I was so full by this time.   The Herb Box also has a beautiful patio with big windows opening to the bar and comfortable, intimate fireplaces. This is such a convenient location right in old town and steps away from the mall, I know it will become a regular place for me."|review|qABKRj1ggJmtvrL9FMFtuA|1|0|2

I wanted to order ahead and take out for dinner. When I arrived, the food was done and I was on my way.

I had already had a bad experience at Target.  Grabbed a cart, which happened to come with a dirty diaper!  WTF is wrong with people?  Then I got behind a woman who kept trying 14 different maxed out credit cards and it took me forever in the check out lane.  I am not having a good feeling at this point.  I should have gotten a breakfast burrito and immediately gone home.  But I had one more stop that I really wanted to make.    I had a book on hold at Hamilton Library that I needed for a class, so I thought I'd swing in there a little after 9 and pick it up.  Now, I am the first to admit when I'm wrong, and at the time I truly thought their Saturday hours were 9-5.  I walk in, find my book, and start using the self-checkout.  Suddenly I hear, ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!?!?!?!?""      Uh.....this is a library....I'm not sure what else I'd be doing.    ""WE ARE NOT OPEN!  HOW DID YOU GET IN?!?!?""    I pointed to the door that I always come in, and said, ""The door right there.""  An older gal who has the same hairdo Priscilla Presley had when she married Elvis, proceeded to totally attempt to make me feel like an idiot.  ""YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT!""  ""Do you mean I can't take the book I just checked out?""  ""DID YOU SEE THE SIGN OUT FRONT?  YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE!!  ARE YOU FINISHED?  OUR HOURS ARE 1-5.  YOU NEED TO GO DOWNTOWN!! WELL GO AHEAD!!""  ""I'm truly sorry if I startled you, but don't you open at 9?""    ""THAT IS THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION ONLY!  THERE'S A SIGN OUT FRONT!  WE ARE NOT OPEN!""  Her diatribe was filled with many sighs and eye rolls.  Oh boy.  Her Monday-Friday job must be with TSA.    Then I said something that's just as dorky as saying, ""oopsie daisy"".  I said, ""Jiminy, I didn't mean to upset you.  Sorry.""  Jiminy.  Oh yeah.  Who says that?  I'm a dork.  She caught me off guard.  Maybe it's because in my day job I frequently have to correct people and I do it in a way that's friendly, at times humorous, and educational so they actually learn.  It's not rocket science, but yelling at and berating people doesn't really tend to work very well.    Normally I find this location slightly frustrating anyway.  I've learned to avoid the peak high school comings and goings, but they put up a one way only sign for the library parking lot, and if you follow the sign, on weekends, it takes you to a locked gate.  Makes no sense.  So, I have to turn around and go against the one way, which everyone else does anyway because the entrance/exit is right on Arizona Ave.  As I left, I realized I should have asked her, ""Who left the door unlocked?"""|review|WxeD74JGiwjljzHndYSvmw|4|3|5

I work about half a mile away from this place, and noticed it was newish driving by. For about 2 months, I intended to try it. Today, I finally took the plunge and walked in not knowing what to expect.   The place is small, and there were only about 4 people sitting at tables, even though there were 3 people working behind the counter. The place is set up kinda like a Chipotle or a Qdoba - you pick the type of meal you want, and right in front of you are all the different options to include.   I choose a bowl and filled it with both types of rice, chicken, grilled eggplant, red pepper hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, and feta. It also came with my choice of a regular pita or a whole wheat pita. Everything looked amazing! Upon my first bites I discovered it TASTED amazing. Everything was good on it's own, and it was every better when I started mixing it all together. I devoured the whole thing. It is very easy to eat healthy here, since everything is so fresh and so tasty.   I strongly urge everyone to try this place -- they need to stay open so I can solidify it as my regular lunch spot.   The customer service was superb too -- they explained to me how the meals worked and even let me try the hummus since I must have looked distraught over having too many options.   My bowl and my pita rang in for less than $8. Fantastic!|review|09r40LAWn3s_ZTnijAlakQ|3|0|1

7IlOc6v_wHXLm5GFPGF0Fg|2012-01-19|r5hD6wFkwD1fYiVaN4-b5g|4|Stopped in to get my pupusas fix. I got the combo of 3 pupusas with rice and beans for $7.95. They had about 10 different pupusas to choose from. I chose: revuelta (cheese, beans & chicharron), steak and cheese and a pork and cheese. I ordered mines to go, and it took a while. Definitely not a place if you're in hurry. I had to wait at least 15 minutes but that's understandable, pupusas usually takes a while to cook.   The pupusas were pretty large. Honestly I made 3 seperate meals out of this one combo. They are served with salvadorean slaw and curtido (a red salsa). The slaw here is fresh and crunchy. It's tasty and great with the pupusas. It also had a distinct oregano flavor that I haven't tasted in other slaws. My favorite of the 3 was the revuelta. The three ingredient filling worked really well together. The sides were good, as well. The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were pretty awesome. It was a little thinner in consistency than normal refried beans but the flavor was pretty damn good. Maybe thats what made the revuelta pupusa my favorite of the 3, the awesome beans they use.  This restaurant would probably rank 3 stars on my pupusas radar but giving the limited el salvadorean restaurants in Phx, it makes it 4 stars.  *If you never had a pupusas I'd probably describe it as a stuffed sope that's crisp up on both sides like a quesadilla.|review|KSTOdz0lSFCkqBSRNwjERA|0|0|0

I have finally decided to post why. I am not from the school of ""one and done"" everybody, well almost everybody when it comes to food get's a second chance. Sometimes even more. I am done with Lo-Lo's however. Here is the phat skinny. I order the KK's. It is 3 pieces of chicken with two waffles, grits and cheesy onion eggs. I have a big ASS Kool-Aid, (wish they had the purple stuff) and I eat the whole damn meal. The waffles are ok for me, they are not as crisp on the outside as I would like and they are soooo thin. The cheese and onion eggs are great. But c'mon, the fried chicken at a fried chicken joint needs to be OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! With all fellow yelpers basically saying that it is I feel like I'm going to be sent off Yelp Island. Fortunately my little sis is a part of Yelp so I may get a free pass...ala second chance! The Fried Chicken here tastes like someone broke out some progresso bread crumbs and a big ass bottle of wesson cooking oil and cooked about 100 batches in the same dirty oil. It just had the burnt dirty oil flavor every time. I am not a fan of that. The Thighs were pretty descent, the breast was horrible. Every time the breast meat is dry, bland and has that off putting oil taste.   So, LO-LO....NO-NO, get some Purple Drink-Mix and keep that damn bird moist. Change the oil more often and I will try again. Untill then I will keep creating my own ""Ghetto Taco"" Thats what we call them in New York.

On my first visits, I stuck with their breakfast menu (I'm such a sucker for breakfast food) and found that the Eggs & Chorizo as well as the Egg Torta are excellent. I've also had the Frutas con Crema, and although it is a simple dish, it too is very well done. Also noteworthy is the Crepas, even though they are a little sweet.   I've since branched out to their dinner menu, and definitely recommend all their tacos (ask if there are any specials!).   As for cocktails, I would recommend the Paloma or the Guero Blanco. A cocktail with horchata?? Yes, please! I've had the Bloody Mary as well, but found that there was a bit too much dill in it for my liking. Their sangria and mimosas are also interesting, although I wasn't terribly impressed with either.   Overall, Gallo is an excellent restaurant with terrific, friendly service and a great atmosphere.

3OauvrqUU8nDLWcW6q9hGQ|2009-10-14|km-JST9kdvbxu_G_Lw6iMA|3|"First off, you have no idea how unbelievably excited I was for this place when I saw the ""opening soon"" sign from the 101 freeway.  Honestly, my first thought was to drive my truck off the highway and go check it out like NOW.    Second, I live in north Phoenix so I HAVE to drive a good 20 minutes plus to get any decent pho.  My fav place right now is Da Vang because it tastes mind-blowing good, is priced very reasonably, and they serve their food quick.    Third, I can't say I would agree with the other two reviews here.  I'm not trying to be confrontational but I've tried 12 different pho spots in the valley and this one rates a 5-stars with the interior decoration but I gave it a 3 stars due the meager serving, the price, and the soup spoon (more about the soup spoon later).  Since I wouldn't mind eating in a dump as long as the food was good, and with pho restaurants, I hate to say this but it's quite normal for the ambiance and the quality of the food to be inversely proportional.  I gave this place a 3.  Naturally, many will disagree with me but hey, I'd rather drive 20 minutes for better tasting pho.  I'll gladly try this place again to give it another chance but these are my first impressions.  When you first walk in, you're greeted by a huge screen that blocks the view of the rest of the restaurant.  ok - kinda cool.  I can dig this feng-shui stuff.  After I used my nimble Chinese-style ninja moves to side step the screen, I was presented by a row of really nice tables and chairs.  I grabbed a seat with a buddy of mine and my first impression of the furniture was ""whoa, I need to work out more"".  These chairs are crazy heavy for a restaurant.  The wooden tables are a nice dark wood that are sturdy enough for an elephant to stand on.  Did you know that elephants are really careful about where they step because of their weight?  Yep, saw that on National Geographic.  I ordered a bowl of pho and out it came with these glass soup spoons in nice dishware.  The broth was ""ok"" but the serving size was a little scant - $7 for a normal sized bowl.  The soup spoon, while nice and pretty, was really shallow and slippery (did I mention it was made of glass) so it was quite difficult to keep the noodles on the spoon.  I have to say ""on"" the spoon because the spoon was so shallow... if it were the normal plastic spoon that you find at your normal pho place, I'd be able to say ""in"" the spoon.  You get the picture.  The broth wasn't as smooth as what I've tasted elsewhere so maybe they haven't gotten down their broth making process or since the whole place is new, maybe they haven't gotten into their pho groove yet.  I dunno because I don't make pho but I've certainly eaten enough of it to comment.  But - try it yourself and post up a review.  Every place deserves at least one chance and this was my impression after my first bowl.

The staff were very nice and accommodating.  They do serve a bowl of rice soup with chicken at the beginning of all courses, had a good flavor and reminded me of a Chinese soup, ""chow"" I tried the yellow curry, with deep fried tofu, the curry has unbelievable flavor indicating it's been prepared well.  I would like smaller chunks of tofu.  The only problem was that the potatoes were not cooked thoroughly.. I hate hard/half cooked vegetables. I also tried the coconut soup, which hands one of the best one I have tried... I did ask for Thai hot.. which was borderline spicy. Overall I recommend this place, one of the more authentic Thai restaurant in the valley and the location."|review|82vsbM8ggZV4BVrtLB9s3A|0|0|0

We were about 15 minutes late, The waitress said it was no problem and we proceeded with the order.      The waitress then came back after about 5 minutes and proceeded to tell us we needed to order a drink with our meal. Which was fine, so we got some beverages. The waitress came back again to tell us that we could not get the deal and we would have to pay full price. After I complained the manager gave us a couple dollars off but I feel that it was not enough and we should have received the deal.      I did not complain further at the table and we ate our meal which was above average; however I feel that our business was not really valued and will not be dining there again.  I understand that mistakes happen and the waitress was new but if we  ordered alcoholic beverages that we were not going to order and then we have to pay extra for things. The service was meh . . .

MXOdsPTLQPsQK9hUq01DWg|2009-08-07|0MjRhwJCQeRhDosAfj0Viw|4|Stopped by Arcadia Tavern tonight around 9:15 pm and it was packed... Granted, it was a perfect evening to be outside for an August night in Phoenix.  The entire patio was full, the bar area had not an empty seat, and from the looks of it, the restaurant was doing some decent biz as well.  Jack Young was the singer/guitar player rockin' the place with tunes from Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffet, and more.    I'd already eaten dinner, but Jared shared a bite of his miso salmon (with rice and asparagus) and it was delicious.  I'm writing this update partially to let it be known that this is just one of the new menu options along with chicken parm, steak salad, edamame, roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, caprese, chopped, and cobb salads.  I guess the feedback made its way to management... I am pleased with the new variety of healthy choices.  Robert, the Chef, came out to say hello - or perhaps we caught him red handed having a drink at the bar... either way, it was nice to see him.   I'll be back on my own sometime soon to order my own miso salmon... and if not me, you'll likely find Jared drinkin' a Guinness at the bar.  Cheers!|review|fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw|8|6|10

I actually woke up this morning craving it. The crust is super fantastic.  I am really boring when it comes to pizza; this meaning that I either only eat plain cheese or I will get a pizza with one item on it.   Someone once told me that getting plain cheese pizza is the best way to judge whether or not a place actually has good pizza. If you load it up with all that junk you can't taste whether the sauce is flavorful or the crust is good. I am here to say that Mellow Mushroom is the real deal. Their pizza is great even without all of the toppings.  I have heard that the specialty pizzas are phenomenal, so despite my normal behavior, I will have to try at least a few of them.  Mellow Mushroom, I will return for your tasty pies.|review|eL2AbD_vXdP57eewFH21lQ|2|2|4

Nevertheless, they really make the effort to make every facet of your round the best it can possibly be at the Stadium Course, and it comes through.  First: the forecaddie.  Every foursome gets one, and I cannot imagine navigating this challenging course without the guidance of our forecaddie, Wally.  Wally knew every inch of the course, and gave us the requisite hole previews, sprinted out into the fairways to find our tee shots, saved us from hazardous cacti in the desert, gave us detailed yardage measurements, and read greens when necessary.  Every read was spot on; he must've saved me at least 5 putts over the course of the round.  The course itself is exquisitely manicured, even just a couple weeks after the WM Open.  The greens are gorgeous, and quite fast but not incomprehensibly so.  Every cut of fairway and rough is pristine, but the coolest part is definitely the desert patches all around (and sometimes within!) the fairways.  The desert contains all manner of exotic cactus and is a veritable nature reserve of itself.  There are also a ton of jackrabbits, chipmunks and birds who are all astonishingly friendly and unafraid (but also unthreatening).  Obviously the final four holes here are the golfing highlight, and they didn't disappoint (despite causing me to make an ""other"" on the par five 15th).  This is one of the most gorgeous four-hole stretches I've ever played, and I would love to have the opportunity to play it again some day.  But for the moment I'll have to settle for watching them on TV next January."|review|bH40h15ScLYilmXssXtf3A|0|0|1

Seventeen enlightening years later, I have rediscovered Tuesday Morning, and all of its knick-knacky goodness.   The name is a bit misleading, because they are open from 10a to 7p Mon- Sat, and Sundays from noon to 6p. They close relatively early to restock every evening, because apparently they get new shipments in every day. Whether or not those shipments include something you want to claim is another story, as this is another one of those hit and miss type stores that requires quite a bit of patience.   The stores have never claimed to be the cleanest or most organized. The aisles are narrow. And by ""narrow"", I mean ""seriously, if you bring your shopping cart down the aisle I am in, you better put that thing in reverse because I'm not moving, and there's not room for all of us"".  Their website describes their product selection as: bed & bath, closet & storage, cookware& house wares, crystal, glass & tabletop, decorative home accents, for your pets, gourmet foods, lawn & garden accents, seasonal and toys. Although at some stores, I have honest-to-God seen clothing, including bathrobes and bras. And no, I have never purchased those from there, thankyouverymuch!  Around the holidays, you can score some great little nuggets for parties, and even gifts (the kind that won't be regifted). I also like their patio section, even though I'm currently living in a one-bedroom condo with a ""patio"" the size of a shoebox. A girl can dream...and plan for my next big place. They also have a small selection of kitchen-type furniture at really reasonable prices.   I've found party favors for an office party, candles and picture frames, and a really cute wine rack.   Overall, if you're planning on making like my mom and browsing through Tuesday Morning, don't wear your Sunday best, because you might get a little dusty, but it will be so worth if you walk out with that perfect entryway table for a steal. And a bra or two."|review|RYUX8y_1-IyLKy3Pc93_zg|3|3|3

lVkDZZ8sTafPlq7f1i5row|2010-09-05|ac4E3_P_MSRi5Km7VNlHkg|4|"This cafe is 100% vegetarian, with the vegan option available on every menu item.  From past experiences with veggie restaurants in Phoenix, this kind of classification would probably make me less eager to try the place......  which is why I'm happy that the chef/owner instead chose to focus on the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients -- vegetarianism is more of an afterthought.  So we decided to try it yesterday for lunch.  To start, Pomegranate offers a wonderful selection of teas, coffees, and various juice/smoothie options.  I wanted something cool and caffeinated, so I ordered the toddy, which features my favorite local roaster's beans -- Cartel.  My wife order a peach iced tea.  Very good, but if memory serves correctly, you won't find any drink options for less than $2.00 or so.  Then onto the main course.  I ordered the veggie burger, which is made from a sprouted tofu, served on a sprouted spelt bun, and garnished with cheddar cheese (or vegan cheese if you prefer), avocado, tomato, and a little tiny dollop of miso mayonnaise.  It also comes with a catch-all selection of sides: salad, tortilla chips, fruit slices, and a pickle.  $10 or so.....  Here's my take on the burger:  The spelt bun was better than any other spelt bun/bread that I've ever had before.  This was perhaps the second most notable part of this burger.  The most notable was the patty itself, which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor.  It was actually one of my favorite veggie burgers ever.  But here's my beef with the preparation: too skimpy on the rich, fatty stuff.  There was a very thin slice of cheese and almost nothing of the single condiment provided, which the menu told me was a miso mayo.  Thanks to the avocado, it was still a little rich, but not the kind of juicy decadence that I've always felt characterizes a great burger.  And seriously, I would have liked to have tasted the miso mayonnaise, but instead added my salad dressing to the burger to make it less dry, and this basically obscured whatever taste the mayo may have offered.  The salad was just fine, garnished with what seemed like a raw berry dressing of some sort.  I had no idea that the white stuff in the plastic cup was also for the salad (apparently a living caesar dressing), until the meal was almost over.  I thought it was my mayonnaise for the burger.  Next time, I'll try to get it right and see how the salad tastes with both dressings.  We also tried the hummus, mainly because it's the perfect baby-appropriate snack for my son to sling all over the restaurant (the remarkably polite staff was also quite pleasant about bringing in a messy toddler, by the way, which is a plus).  The hummus was actually quite tasty, but somehow not in a ""traditional"" way.  It seemed a little crisper and fresher than most hummus I've had, which was a nice complement to the fresh veggies served with it.  My only additional request for the hummus is that perhaps the restaurant could throw in a few tortilla chips as well?  My wife tried the vegan BLT, made with a tempeh-based bacon.  It must have been tasty, because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish.  She literally devoured it and then criticized me for nitpicking at the veggie burger's preparation.  I'm pretty sure she'd give this place a 5-star rating, and she may convince me to do the same on our return visit with the in-laws, who have been looking for a place like this.  Oh, one final note.  I spoke with the chef/owner after our meal, to offer our compliments and inquire about the cuisine and the marketplace, etc.  She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies, which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients.  Well done, chef."|review|HZ3ItZ23xZHqjUjRIdPi7Q|8|6|10
d_8bMNQd0mesbEUeq1U2kQ|2008-11-29|SX-JbeygQe4iighmh2WQLQ|3|Went here for the lunch buffet, which was about $12 a person.  The papadum were nice and light. The pakora were cold and soggy. Of the two chicken dishes in the buffet, I tried the chicken tikka masala which was ok. Instead of having the chicken Korma, I had the vegetable korma which was tasty. My favorite of the vegetable dishes was the chickpea dishes which had a bit of spice to it but was not overwhelming or overly spicy - I would have liked to try a spicy dish. I was disappointed in the sag paneer - usually one of my favorites but hadn't tasted one like this - not sure why I didn't like it as much as  I usually do. It tasted like spinach and a little mint of something like that but couldn't figure out the rest of it.  The other vegetable dish was ok.  A couple of minutes after we sat down freshly cooked Tandori chicken and Nan were brought to the table. Both were tasty. I tried both of the desserts - the galub (i can't remember how to spell the rest of it) and the rice dessert - both were very sweet and tasty. One of us had the mango lassi which was sweet and good.    Overall the buffet was ok - don't know how long the food was sitting out so I can't comment on that.  I think I would come back for dinner to order from the menu instead of having the buffet again.  I gave three stars more because in comparison to other Chandler restaurants its a bit better than what I've been having here lately - as far as compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to out of state - this was a little disappointing. I'll try something from the menu sometime to see how it compares to the buffet.|review|7htYqcN-F-c3LwKTEG1Mfg|1|0|1

At one point a couple years ago, the food service and quality became, for lack of a better term, lazy.  Periodically we return to see if things have changed.  Last night returned for the first time in about a year and unfortunately found not much has changed.  They somehow have moved away from a more classy menu to this big plastic sheet.  Makes me think of being at chillis..... In addition there was some sticky stuff on the menu which I wasn't to pleased about avoiding.  We started with the pork dumplings.  They were loose, a little cold and a tasted as though they had been sitting around for some time.  This is curious because we received them about 2 minutes after they were ordered.  The more important part for us is the sushi itself.   We had:   Pinwheel.... Sloppily put together.  Fish was extremely thick. Tuna, yellowtail, seabass nigiri.  Everything was warm and we believed the sushi was not cut right it somehow seemed hard, lacking of the proper texture and simply did not taste fresh.  The server was very good by the way.  For our money ,we will stick with stingray and probably try pure again in another year.  I imagine they plan to be around since they committed to the great expense of plastic menus.|review|fIL-xbhuBoUc1FaMvyb5iA|1|1|1

The atmostphere is romantic - a cozy old house with cute little rooms, small tables with checked table cloth, soft lighting, the works.  They have fine food that's worth the price and it's a great date night experience.  On this last visit, our server was incredibly slow, beyond reasonable levels. She was nice enough, but we ended up running late for our next engagement, even though we arrived quite early.  She even took over five minutes processing our credit card after we said we were in a hurry, twice.  The restaurant was far from packed fairly early on a Thursday.  The people near us came in later and left earlier with the same number of courses (and a good server).    In addition to being slow, she wasn't very helpful.  We ordered the crab cakes, which came with vegetables that were a little bland, and the stuffed pepper, which was so spicy that my husband and I both burned our mouths.  The server eventually came by and asked how we liked our food, and when we mentioned the screaming spice, she specifically said the dish wasn't meant to be at all spicy - then proceeded to do nothing about it.  Thank goodness another server who had a table nearby kept our waters full.   Our shrimp cocktail appetizer had big, beautiful shrimp, and our creme brulee dessert was delicious.  The crab cakes themselves were great, and I could tell that the pepper dish would have been nice, if it hadn't been so incredibly spicy.  They clearly just forgot to clean out the seeds.  Luckily, my husband and I were in good spirits and the poor service and food issues didn't put a damper on our night.    We've been here many times and tried many menu items, including the crab cake sandwich, the meatloaf, the crab benedict at brunch, their mimosa and bloody mary, etc.  We've never had poor service or over-spicy food before, so I am leaving this review at 4 stars - it's an average of two for this visit and 5 for every other time we've visited.|review|L9-X4KASFfdhOeVeYSDgvA|1|0|2

I went again last night for my birthday and had a fantastic meal. The chips that come out when you sit down are warm and fresh and super crispy and they are probably the best chips I have ever had in a restaurant. The salsa is so good and has a really nice kick of spicy that I love. The drinks are super strong, I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, which I like because I don't drink often (in fact the last time I drank was the last time I was at Fuego Tacos) but when I do drink I want to feel buzzed and these drinks will get you there about halfway through one drink. Either that or I am a super lightweight. The specialty drinks on the menu are $5, but I guess custom drink orders not on the menu are a bit more because my Long Island was $7. Beer I think is $4.   I ordered the spicy vegetable tacos again but this time with soft shells, and they were much better. I didn't even finish them this time because I was so full. I also got a full plate of black beans again. They make me happy. My husband got the shrimp tacos and he liked them much better than the fish tacos he got last time. We also ordered the churros and they were delicious. Hot and crispy with what our waiter called a spicy chocolate dipping sauce but I didn't taste anything spicy. Tasted more like bananas to me. But it was good either way. Our waiter was fantastic. He said things like ""love it"" and it made me laugh.   It sad to walk through the Esplanade and it not be busy at all. It seems strange to put this restaurant in this location since it doesn't seem to be doing well.

I am new to Phoenix (4 months) and have had some of the most wonderful dining experiences. As an east coast city girl I know great food and the valley of sun has great options.   I have visited AZ bread company for lunch more than 5 times, it's right near my office and the salads are really great. I've thought it was a bit overpriced, but not grossly so.   This morning I stopped by for my first breakfast experience. I asked for a bagel with egg and cheese and brown mustard (sold other places for $3-3.50. What I was told is that I would be charged for a breakfast sandwich with no meat. I assumed this was some kind of deduction from the price of the full sandwich. With a coffee my bill was $7.11 after tax. When I asked why it was so expensive I was pretty much given a ""sorry."" On their menu a bagel is $.99, an egg is $.95 and I can't imagine cheese can be more than $1. I should have been charged $3 not $5. I mentioned this to the cashier with no luck. What I was handed was a bagel with American cheese (YUCK) and an egg and honey mustard (the wrong mustard). I should have been asked what kind of cheese I wanted.   In this economy gouging a new customer and then handing them the wrong food just doesn't fly. Sorry AZ, I won't be back. Kind of a shame...loved those salads."|review|cXK4sQXa_DNCebmdSfpSOg|0|0|1

And Sandler and Farley are true comic gems. http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&VideoID=31956578   I did not realize that we came to lounge by the pool on the last day of the Phoenix Gay Pride weekend. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I wanted to have a splash fight with all the hot guys. To be fair, Nico enjoyed the lovely ladies too.   I loved the decor inside and pool side. Vibrant colors and just a cool, hip vibe to the place. The entrance plastic banner was a little unexpected, but it's clear to see they are in the middle of some upgrades. I'm sure they will have a trendy-looking, bright sign up in no time.   We lounged and had a few drinks before I spilled half of my awesome Lemon Drop on the pool deck. The female bartender said it was a secret recipe. It hit the spot in the hot sun.   After pool time, we headed up to the roof top bar to check things out. It was about 5pm and a staffer was setting up for the evening. The views were great and we took a few photos with the skyline in the background. I could see this place would be a blast at night.   I'm looking forward to heading back soon. I see on their website that the restaurant is open. A girlfriend and I may actually go today after work. I'm craving a Lemon Drop and splash fight!|review|Q96IRvil6RNgdLmGKuh81A|17|19|15

My pedi was good (why do they insist on putting polish on!?) but the woman did take out a little too much cuticle on one toe.  When I protested (because it hurt) she looked around as if to check if anyone heard :/  Then when I was paying, and here's the helpful tip, she says ""for you $33"".  I hand her my debit card and pull out $5 cash for the tip, since they are kind enough to advertise that they prefer cash tips *stay classy*, and she says ""oh 28...""!!

Most recently I went in for happy hour and it took about 20 minutes to get our food while people who say after us got their food first. At the time we got the check I told our waiter that we were there for happy hour and that our check did not reflect those prices and she said that because we got seated a few minutes before happy hour started (probably 5-10 minutes before) she had to charge us full price. We are regulars there for happy hour, the hostess even recognized us so there rationale was ridiculous.  For the past few times I gone there the service has been ridiculous!|review|1Eim9DzVZT3QmzUKUXOLaQ|0|0|1

I enjoy many of the qualities of a restaurant that aims to be a finer-end establishment, such as this one, but I can equally enjoy a hole-in-the-wall if the food and service are good.  This restaurant had neither.   - Incompetence - I just had an evening here with a large group.  The management was very professional, as was our waiter in tending to our guest's needs.  Several things went wrong, however, and the food is just not good.  We ordered plates of the fries and aioli for the table.  One friend is severely lactose-intolerant, so we asked that fries be provided without the cheese.  Finally, 20+ minutes later his fries arrived, but still with cheese.  His entre later in the evening also had cheese he asked not to be included.   - Overrated Drink Options - It's true there is an encyclopedic drink menu, although most the options are overpriced for what you get.  When I was waiting for friends at the bar before our meal, the bartender was rude and stopped filling my order halfway through to talk to her coworker for several minutes.  - Horrible food - Let me cut to the chase on this one.  I ordered the lamb meatballs. I got a full entre. They were inedible.  The lamb apparently died in a pepper mill explosion. I should have sent the dish back but we were already behind schedule on the rest of our evening, and I couldn't wait for them to correct the problem.  I can't think of the last time I ate something that was so horrible I couldn't bear to finish it. I like almost anything.  There were other problems with the food.  The greens in my salad had spoiled.  Many other guests did not enjoy there meals.  It's true that most of the entres are overpriced, so they offer ""medium"" sized or tapas options. This is just pretentious.  If your entre was decent enough to eat, customers won't mind paying more.  Several people ordered the salmon full entre and it was a thinly-sliced piece of barely cooked salmon on a plate.  The food all came in stupid iron pans that are too small to reach in and cut your meat with a knife.  - Checks - For our dozens guests or so, our polite waiter was not polite enough to allow us to charge the bill to separate credit cards. I don't know how you're supposed to pay a $500 bill in cash among so many people. We should have brought a cpa to tabulate our invoice.  The waiter did include his 20% gratuity, thankfully.  In conclusion, skip this restaurant."|review|4n2YKHdzgnYISYscxwmWvw|0|0|2

The Spur Burger was really good but it really needs a sturdier bun for the size of the burger and toppings...The bottom bun was soggy. Maybe they should place the lettuce and/ or the onion on the bottom bun to keep it  from getting soggy...fries were very good and seasoned perfectly for my taste...the bartender/ waitress could have been a bit friendlier.

We ordered the cheese crab puffs and the potstickers.  I'd pass on the cheese puffs, they had a bizarre flavor, that I still can't put my finger on.  The pot stickers were perfect.  I ordered the pepper beef and it was very good.  The red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce.  It came with white rice, which I'm not use to, since I usually have brown, but that was fine also.  Decor is fine, a little 60's china-ish but it seems to suit the place.  From the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves, it seems they agree with me.  This place is a hit.|review|THYIqfnLV54VZ_v2hCfq2Q|0|0|1

He clearly was over his head with my medical issues (which weren't really that complex) and threw a crazy cocktail of medicine at me instead of trying to figure out what was wrong (or referring me to another doctor). I trusted him and gave it time and saw him at least 30 times - he was the doctor after all - and finally switched doctors. The new doctor was horrified not just at my personal experience, but at the cocktail of medicine that could have killed me. The new doctor immediately took me off all of them and treated the source. I felt 95% better in one week. I think that alone speaks for why my rating is the lowest.    I think it important to warn friends and family against him. If you have something simple like a cold, flu, or allergies he would be a good doctor to go to because you can get in immediately  - always -....  If you have anything more complex than that consider other options. The actual office facility is gorgeous and the waiting room is very accommodating, which I unfortunately think (combined with what I said above) suggests mixed up priorities.|review|k-0wMUAzj4Q8jPjvwvrc5Q|0|0|0

He doesn't get to spend a lot of time interacting with other small kids so it's great for him (and hilarious for me) to watch him make friends.  He could stay for hours. It's small enough to not lose track of your kids, and lots of fun toys to keep little ones busy. My older one didn't like this place much, he got bored of the tiny tots and toys after one lap around. I agree with other reviewers who say it's GOOD to follow your kid. You dont have to breathe down their necks but my son was hit in the head by another little girl with no parent in sight and I was left to do damage control. If your kid is not old enough to know about keeping their hands to themselves, and sharing, please keep a close eye on them.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean.

I heart Jason Millstein of Illume Photography.  From the moment we met Jason, we knew he was the one that we would choose to capture the memories of our wedding day.  Jason's work speaks for itself.  His passion and his background in photojournalism are evident in the images he captures... and his energy and enthusiasm are contagious!   Not only is Jason professional, but he made the process fun!  Jason met us to do a walk through on site prior to the big day, so we would know what to expect.  And when the day arrived, we felt at ease with Jason in control.  He pushed us just enough so that we would keep to our schedule and get pictures of everything we requested.  He and his team were personable with our family and friends and Minnie too!  It was crazy hot on our wedding day, but the crew worked through the heat...   To date, I've only seen a preview of the images that Jason took on our wedding day, but the ones I saw are amazing.  I'm confident that I'll be extremely pleased when I see the rest.  (I'll update my review when I do.)

I visited this spot while on vacation, on my next to last day, and wish I had gone earlier so I could have eaten here multiple times.   This restaurant is located in a smallish strip mall. It has a very casual atmosphere, a walk up counter for ordering and a bunch of booths and tables to eat at. There are colorful murals on the walls, actually pretty cute.   The employees were friendly and helpful, and my co-eater and I both got a combo and a sope. I would say the tacos were the best draw, followed by the enchiladas, then the tamales. The rice and beans were tasty too. The sauce on the enchilada and tamale was delicious. I really wish I was able to try more. This place is on my to-do list for the next time I'm in the area!

The reviews here are overwhelmingly positive but I feel the need to respond to the couple of folks who complained about having to wait and about not being able to be seen right away.  First - from lots of experience with this clinic I can assure you long waits are unusual and related to unexpected urgencies in someones pet.  Second - the complaints I read about not being seen right away sounded like the writers are expecting emergency service at this clinic.  It's not an emergency clinic.  They don't pretend to be an emergency clinic.   Expectations need to be realistic -  someone complained that they had a new kitten with a runny eye so they just showed up and asked to be seen.  They are always booked solid but even though this person just showed up unscheduled at a non-emergency clinic, they offerred to let the person leave the kitty so they could work it in but this person decided to complain about that too. Ridiculous.   Dr. Bennet is my primary vet and I have complete trust in her but my pets have seen every doctor there at some point because they do make room and offer other vets when they need to do so.  My pets and I have recieved nothing by high quality service and excellent care.  In fact, this clinic and it's doctors have gone out of the way on a couple of occassions in order to make room at a moments notice when trying to turn an ailing cat's health around, and to follow up with me, off hours on a Sunday, after another kitty had to have surgery.    Excellent care, excellent service.  Don't treat them like an emergency room and you won't be dissappointed.|review|gSXiUnctbjjnwVfKg9-0Ag|0|0|0

I like that I can score with one drink special or another most regularly, but I wish the music was better - but I say that about everywhere I go, so I'm not gonna hold it against them.    The staff's friendly more often than not, and the food is decent.  I like going on Tuesday's for fish tacos.  I think they're like 7 or 8 bucks, and you get three of them.  They're big, too.  And they come with chips and salsa.  Good stuff, overall.  This place has so much more potential, though...  If only they had a real jukebox.  I should note that for those of you who haven't been down there in a while - they've expanded the patio and its pretty righteous.  A nice place to grab an outdoor couch for a Sunday brunch.  Get there before 8:30 or 9 at night, though, when you go... otherwise you'll most likely be paying a cover charge.  Even on most Wednesdays or Thursdays.

But even then, they will only come depending on the food options and free promotions available to them on that particular day.    Alright Diamondbacks Nation... well maybe not nation, maybe Diamondbacks fans? Nope, there aren't enough of you for that title either. What about supporters? Maybe groupies? Well whatever you're called, where are you? You've got one gorgeous baseball field and a World Series title, yet this stadium sits lifelessly in the Arizona desert.   It's sad actually. Chase Field is gorgeous, and dare I say... breathtaking. Stretching far and wide across the Phoenix skyline, Chase Field stands tall among the buildings that call downtown Phoenix home. This technological work of art brought baseball to the desert, and that's quite a feat. Even some of baseballs greatest players, like The Big Unit for example, have called it home. Sparkling clean and strategically situated for easy access and parking, Chase Field calls out to ""D-Backs fans"" - begging them to venture though its towering gated entrance to seek sanctuary within its cool climate controlled atmosphere. All of the vendors, ushers and ballpark staff at this stadium are also welcoming, helpful and friendly. There isn't a bad seat at Chase Field. The view is virtually perfect from every angle. Yet the seats remain fan-less.    I do understand part of the reason why fans don't flock to Chase Field. An empty stadium is a common transplant state/expansion team symptom, like the desolate Tropicana Field for example. Most people in Arizona probably aren't even ""D-Backs fans"". I get that. I'm not one. But even I pay more attention to the action at Chase Field and have more admiration of its beauty than a majority of those ""D-Backs fans.""   It is as if ""D-Backs fans"" are confused, and they think Chase Field is an indoor shopping mall - because in between the shopping, the food, the activities, the awful emcee that talks in between innings, the dancing and the trivia games, none of the ""D-Backs fans"" seem to have time to watch baseball.    So ""D-Backs fans"" - you need to up your appreciation level for the game. It's the roar of the crowd that brings a stadium to life. Team pride is what makes or breaks a ballpark's atmosphere. And when you are talking on your phone through an entire at bat, standing up right in the middle of a crucial pitch to get more ballpark chow or allowing your children to turn empty seats into their own personal jungle gym or hide and go seek game, why even come to the stadium? Go to the mall or visit a park for that matter. Regardless of whether you're in first place or last place, this is your team in your city. It's not enjoyable to see such beauty go to waste. So stop swimming in your indoor ballpark pool (I still can't believe how tacky that pool looks in the outfield), worry about what ice cream extravaganza you are going to stuff your face with later, and let's watch some baseball!    It's called game time ""D-Backs fans"", not play time."|review|w4suxL1zlxsihVlugZZDAQ|0|0|0

Both were great shows and it seems like Stand Up Live is getting many more big acts. I'll definitely return to this venue in the future for some of my favorite comedians, but I will always go to the early shows which start at 7:30pm and the doors open at 6:30pm.  When I went to the late show for the Sklar Brothers in December it started late and waiting in that line sucks. I went to the early Friday show for Stephen Rannazzisi and there was no line and we got a better seat at center stage. As others have mentioned, there is a two drink minimum, but that is pretty standard for most comedy clubs, so I wouldn't complain. I've also tried the pretzels with cheese dip and the chicken tenders. Both were great and I would get them again.  My only issue with this place (and it's been mentioned in many other reviews) is the crammed seating at the tables in front of the stage. They really need to remove some of the tables to allow the patrons to be more comfortable and not struggle to watch the show. Next time I go with friends I am considering getting one of the high top tables in the back to be more comfortable since I don't really care about being up close to the stage.  Another tip is to park in the garage at City Scape since the first three hours are free with a validation from Stand Up Live. After that it is only $2 per hour.  Before the show I highly recommend going to Copper Blues next door for dinner and drinks. The burgers are awesome and they have about 60 beers on tap. I'll be posting a review for them soon!|review|34gJ_KlP3RM6jotNT6TcDQ|2|0|5

I can always seem to find something I like, and with cajun food, I am pretty easy to satisfy.  We decided to give Lafitte's a try, although we wondered what a cajun restaurant was doing in an Embassy Suites Hotel.  We did manage to find it, and we were pleasantly surprised.  The menu was not all cajun/creole dishes - it is a general restaurant for the hotel so there are a number of different menu items for those not interested in cajun.  Although we didn't get to try everything, we did opt for our usual  - gumbo and shrimp etoufee, and a cup of jambalaya. We were pleasantly surprised - all were fairly authentic, and quite good. The size of the servings were larger than normal, which was nice.  It might be noted that the jambalaya is not your typical restaurant version - it is a rice mixture covered in a very dark roux. We both loved it, but we are use to dark rouxs - many would feel the taste offsetting.  Only two minor negatives.  It would have been nice if they would have had at least one beer from Louisiana - the beer list was really limited, which was surprising to me. And a person might want to order extra rice, as the portions were large, but came with only one scoop of rice.  The prices were more than reasonable, and I am sure we will return to try other menu items.|review|w_hcSjqLeSZQL9Rx1UP-Tw|3|2|6

Why did they choose Phoenix when 99% of the attendees weren't even from Arizona? Who knows! It's right off the freeway so it was easy to find.   The resort fee is outrageous, but I'm glad that was waived because we were part of a group block. Getting around the resort was easy and all the buildings were a very short walk to each other. Restaurants were very limited so we either ate at the Lobby Grill or drove off the property to some nearby restaurants.  Since I'm no longer a broke college kid, I refused to sardine twenty people into one room. I shared a two-bed ""Resort Suite"" with two of my associates and before we got into an intense battle of rock-paper-scissors on who gets a bed to herself, we discovered the couch was a pullout. Each of us had our own beds and we were nice and happy. If you really wanted to get ghetto, you can easily sleep six or more. The minifridge was already stocked, but the girls at the front desk told us we could just put everything aside to make room for our own food and drinks.  We didn't get to go to the water park so I can't really report on that. All in all, I had a great experience and would return here again."|review|g6k4mQt0EkAfgWuPc8R3yg|0|0|0

The infused sake was good and wallet friendly however it was very weak, not like regular sake, I feel they must have diluted it with juice and not actually used an infusion process. This is not where my disappointment comes from. The service was horrible, and our server made it seem as if we were the problem and she didn't want to be bothered by us. I only got to try one roll because the rest of my food that I ordered, on the same order card, never came. They brought out my one roll on the same plate with one roll from another persons order card, who ordered her food 30 minutes before me. She got her second roll 45 minutes later after asking the waitress about it. Another girl had to wait 30 minutes for her first drink. I have been a waitress before and even if you are extremely busy the server should never make the customer feel like they are are a burden to them. Regardless of what the reason was, the service was terrible and the restaurant should either replace these types of servers or make sure that they have enough staff to handle the volume of customer they get on Saturday nights. I would not pick this as a place to eat.|review|x2z9XB8moQWpAF2fCbuyFQ|0|0|0

I ordered the lunch Blackened Catfish with Shrimp Etouffee Pistolette and Dirty Rice.  The catfish was sweet and tender and oh so yummy.  The Shrimp Etouffee Pistolette was a dish of their outstanding Etouffee with a hunk of French bread so decadent, I think they actually dunked it in melted butter and then deep fried it (Texas State Fair anyone?).

We were in the area with another couple from out of town and, when asked where we should go for drinks and munchies, I pounced on Rosie's as an idea.  I wooed them with talks of the great Irish and UK beers you have... the fantastic service we've always gotten... Irish band that's sure to be there... cigar friendly patios upstairs and down... great legit Irish food that even includes a boxty.  Despite the fact that you sold a giant billboard space that almost covers your entire establishment (right in line with the most tacky thing I've ever seen - and it doesn't even advertise for anything Irish at all), the out-of-town couple still found it okay after getting caught at a light we made.  Walking in, I had my chest puffed out a little like ""See?!  Told you!""  The atmosphere was great, as always, with a live Irish band and all!  We were greeted at the door by a waitress who told us to have a seat wherever we wanted.  We headed to the downstairs patio (which has a nice new extension, btw)...... and it was downhill from there..........  The patio chair cusions were absolutely soaked from the misters.  I don't mean damp... I mean puddles in every chair.  That's just goofy and means your misters are dripping water and not misting it.  This is typically an easy fix, so we just took the cushions off the chairs and figured we'd tell the waitress when she came out - that way management can get it fixed.  10 minutes later...... no waitress...  I went back inside and bellied up to the bar and asked for some menus and let the barkeep know we were sitting out on the patio.  ""Oh, okay.  No problem.  Here are a couple menus and the beer list is right here.""  ""Hey, by the way, your misters pretty much just soak all your seating and aren't working right.""  ""Yeah, I know.  They always do that.""  ...... okay.......  Thinking I sufficiently notified the staff of our presence, I headed back out with the menus and we all decided what we were having.  5 more minutes later....... no waitress...  Well this is just silly..... I'll go in to the bar and belly up and order what we want.  So... that's what we did!  The guys went in and ordered a craft beer bucket with one of each that they allowed you to select, a couple different beers, and a mixed drink.  I took that all out...... to discover they messed up the beer choices in the bucket... gave a Kilkenny a half-and-half was ordered....... what a hot mess the service is at this place!  We NEVER did see a waitress...... NEVER.  We finished our 8 beers and a mixed drink and NEVER got served (firget about the mister issue - nobody existed to care)!  We went elsewhere to eat.  The place is still a very nice interior (despite the horrific billboard exterior now)... great beers... great patios... live Irish band............... but do you think our out-of-town guests will ever come back to this place (they have a second home in the Valley)?  No way...... and it'll be a long time before we do, either.  Sad to see such crappy service bring an otherwise great place down....."|review|yy3jXczrKljJGzjo24HWfw|0|1|4

On this visit, we selected Cowboy Ciao, based on the outstanding rating and reviews in Yelp. Yelpers, you didn't let us down! This is absolutely THE BEST place we've experienced on all of our sojourns, and we've been to some really good places! There's lots of good stuff to talk about, but the food was so out-of-this-world, let's focus on that. We started with the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry, a smaller version of their ""signature dish"". The ancho sauce was so incredible that we ordered a ciabatta, not because we really wanted bread, but it would have been criminal to leave even a drop of the sauce behind. Next we had a special appetizer, seared scallops with a shrimp bisque. The scallops were melt-in-your-mouth perfect and the bisque became the next target for the ciabatta, which itself was served with two absolutely delicious olive spreads. We couldn't imagine the dinner getting any better than what was already perfect, but our main courses delivered! We both had the duck breast, a new addition to the menu, replacing the Duck Duck Duck. The duck breast was prepared expertly, rare on the inside, with crisp skin, and bathed in another killer sauce, this time ancho-orange. All remaining scraps of ciabatta were used to wipe our plates clean. We washed all of this incredible food down with a bottle of 2002 K Vintners Syrah, a steal at $62. Their wine list is the largest I have ever seen, but our attentive waiter, Bryan, recommend the K Vintners, and we savored every drop. Bryan was very knowledgeable about the menu and deftly guided us through our completely over-the-top dining experience.

The corn was d'lish, as was the Carne Asada Burrito, though it was a tad small for $5.45. (They offer a larger one for $7.95) I guess I'm spoiled living in San Diego where I can get a Carne Asada burrito for super cheap! But I have to say the meat here was wayyyy better than most I've had at home. There was not ONE SINGLE bit of fatty gristle in my burrito.  And the burrito was simply made with only a few ingredients (meat, guac, pico de gallo, and onions) so I could really taste the smoky goodness of the meat. I liked it a lot. In fact, I liked it so much I went there twice in one weekend!  Try the corn with cotija cheese - YUM! And also make sure to drink one of America's Margarita's.

XJv7dUb5fMRaZAWVZjhtvw|2011-12-12|_OBzt8WMZyEP81RtsF9s8Q|4|"I went after a Holiday shop event at my twin group organization.  Someone mentioned that Coach had an additional 30% off on items that were already 50% off.  Of course, I had to go see that, I had never been to the outlets and I am not one to go to them, because most are not worth the time.  However, like my husband would say, whenever I hear sale, something starts ringing in my head and it becomes like an Olympic competitive event for me.  So, armed with this information I drove from central Scottsdale to Anthem, yes, about 30 miles out of the way.  What can I say, I don't mind driving?  The energy in the mall was bustling, it was really busy on a Saturday evening.  I parked near the Coach store, my feet were already killing me, even though I was wearing this Cole Hahn shoes ""with Nike technology"" that are supposed to be easier on your feet.  Of course, my hubby had to chime in, he said I am not supposed to wear heels for over 9 hours, but back to the outlet, the energy was so intense I wanted to stay and check out the other stores.  I tried, but darn my feet were hurting.  I have to come back and check out the rest.  By the way, I am not known for my sensible shoes, but they are really beautiful."|review|8p4at4zdzCpueAmSBaorZA|2|2|2

My tenant calls me 9pm Saturday to say the refrigerator has defrosted and she has no power in the front part of the house....""Ya don't say"",  is all I can think of! My husband, Mr. Fix it, is out of town and I need help, um, NOW! No the circuit breaker is not flipped to off, which is as far as my electrical knowledge extends.  I offer to pay for a hotel, ouch!   So, first thing on Sunday I start dialing and 14 calls later, I reach Mike at Dodge Electric. Do know how tough it is find an electrician who works on something other than A/C?    I explain the problem and the age of the house - 30 years - and he tells me the parts will be tough but he will go to work on it right away and he does. 5 hours later, I have a happy tenant who has a working refrigerator, a bunch of new wiring and electricity through out the house. Also, he tells me that the line running to the house needs to be worked on and gets APS to do their part.   These guys are great, honest, hard working and affordable.

With that said, it is a bit different for the neophyte to the characteristics of the Vietnamese kitchen. It has different smalls, suttle tastes and sometimes present consistencies that the Western eater aren't ready for.   But this shouldn't discourage the adventurer. The food is good, and it isn't that hard to stay on a meat free path. The service have room to improve, but I shouldn't venture there.. I seem to be a privately owned business, so I should let them run this place as they see fit.

Most of the office staff is nice but Lydia is not. She refuses to deal with me when I call.

It was delicious, so a few days later I popped by Top's to see if it was available. I couldn't find any on their shelves so the guys up front took down the name of the drink and my number, promising to give me a call if they could scare some up.  Less than a week later my phone rings, it's the folks at Top's letting me know that they have this awesome new cider in stock. I can't think of any other place that will turn around a customer request so quickly, this has locked me in as a loyal customer. Their prices might be a bit higher than a big-box store, but supporting a local business with amazing service is entirely worth it.|review|d60Tvvuy-7o9LmzwF12nyA|0|0|2
Q2FaJ3zB6ZuGgvqUqhdc_w|2012-10-29|q4BXo6-FrboWVZpdiRvowg|4|"OK.. First let me say I am a fan. Very tasty and unique flavored street tacos. I ordered the al pastor with the pineapple and the flavors were wonderful. Loved the taste of the tortillas. Yes, they are more of the smaller street taco size but not anywhere near the ""not much bigger then a 50 cent coin""  post I saw earlier.  As a person being conscious of calorie counting right now I loved that ithis restaurant only uses one tortilla per taco as opposed to some other places that put two tortillas per taco just to make them more filling, and that Milagro concentrated more on the flavor.  I also ordered the rancho beans which were very tasty and served in a small side pot.  Very friendly service from the waiter and a comfortable atmosphere even for one person dining alone. I do plan on returning, as my waiter suggested, for the Saturday brunch they have coming up for cervezas on the patio and some football watching.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is just the price point.  $15 for 3 tacos and a side of beans is a bit more on the pricey side for a lunch meal. I think they will figure that out with all the feedback and of course the build out on the place could not have been cheap.  When that happens my star will surely become a 5.  I for one am hoping this place sticks around."|review|vwkbXfn1j6yDGcv9VgePaw|0|0|0

We walked in and the whole ""Man vs Food"" situation was posted everywhere.  We decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta and ordered to split.  I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when we asked for chips and salsa the server let us know they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  Our torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) ok so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is every animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) ok so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was done once my boyfriend voiced that there was NO FLAVOR in the sandwich.  I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and Travis got a sprite.  We tried it at least? Bleh."|review|n6LeAoIuDR3NfIBEsmL_zg|0|1|0

This is also my favorite of the Thai Basils in the area because they are more heavy-handed with their spice. (If you don't like your Thai that hot, go to the one of University.) They have the best lettuce wraps in town (forget P.F. Chang's), and they also are willing to grab your extra lettuce as they are more than generous with the chicken. Their Tom Ka Ga is amazing and light, with the most incredible little porcini mushrooms floating about. My favorite is the eggplant dish, medium, with tofu. (I'm not vegetarian; I just really love the way they fry their tofu.) Everything I have had, though, is incredible, and you cannot go wrong.  This is also a great place for large parties. We've shown up last minute with 12-15 people, and they accommodated us without hesitation. They also have great memories, and if you, like me, have a favorite, they will remember it :)   PS Get the Thai iced tea to heal the burn.|review|MvdjWYVMZ96sgU7OB7xLww|0|0|1

How can a chef mess up cooking a chicken breast?? The center was so pink! Apparently it happened twice that day. They happily fixed it for us and apologized...but I was expecting more. The manager could have came out and explained why this happened (new chef possibly, etc), they could have taken something off of our bill, given us free dessert, given us an extra side ...something!

So, a little disappointed, we turned around and hit the IHOP on Central that we had passed 5 minutes before. We already knew the quality of the food would be fine, as all IHOPs are fairly consistent. But what impressed us was the friendliness and happiness of the staff that morning. We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by Anita at the front register. She looked around and seeing all the staff was busy, she bussed a table for us and sat us immediately. We were impressed right there. Then we were served by Kamal, who was super friendly, attentive and in a great mood. But it wasn't just the 2 people we had direct contact with. Must have been the Easter spirit or something, but the whole staff seemed to have smiles on their faces while we were there. We kept noticing and commenting to each other how odd it was to see happy restaurant staff (how sad is that?) I can't remember the last time my boyfriend and I went out for a meal and called the manager over to tell her that we were thrilled with the service. On a $22 check, we left $35.

So finally, after 28 years of living (or visiting) in Arizona, I venture to Daily Dose to meet a friend for breakfast on a Friday. Why did it take so long you ask? Well, I'm not for waiting in line for an hour for breakfast on the weekends.  I'm not really a fan (I'd rather eat lunch or dinner options) of breakfast and can't justify waiting that long. Anyhow, my fiend's schedule and mine happened to align where we could meet for breakfast and I suggested this spot cause I knew it would probably be the only time I would be able to walk right in. I picked a spot on one of the four high top tables outside and ordered a cafe caramel ($4.25) while I waited for my friend. The waitress brought me a water while I waited for my drink to be made and it came with a cucumber in it! I love cucumber water! A few minutes later and my coffee came out and it was super delicious! My friend showed up, looked at my drink and decided in a cappuccino, that she says was really tasty as well.   For our entree, we decided to split the Smokey stuffed portabella mushroom that is stuffed with egg whites, roasted red pepper, and smoked gouda. Yes, I said smoked gouda!! It's served with fresh fruit and toast. We asked our super friendly waitress what we could get besides the toast and she started to tell us we could get cottage cheese, potatoes, or a sweet potato hash that has grilled onions. We opted for the sweet potatoe hash, like I'm sure you, dear reader, would have chosen. We also decided to split the Strawberry ginger snap granola and ordered an extra two egg whites .   Oh my freaking gawd! Everything was so incredibly delicious, my friend and I couldn't stop talking about what idiots we were for not trying this place out sooner. The total for everything, and it was a lot of food that we couldn't even finish, was $31.00! What the bleep? All that delicious food and drinks for $31! This is the best place ever and I would so wait for 30-45 minutes (but not an hour) to eat here again. Everything on the menu looked delicious and it will be hard not to order what I had because it was so good, but I'm excitied to try out the other options,  So thank you Daily Dose for making me feel like dumbass. Can't wait until we meet again!|review|fl6oI21uXoxVMwfR6lFanQ|1|2|3

Everyone else who is offering reviews is doing a nice job of talking about the food so I am going to mention a few different items of interest.  But about the food I will just quickly mention if you are having breakfast it may sound unusual but get the meatball as a side dish. It blew me away.  Not only does Liberty market offer Gilbert residents quality food, they do it at a reasonable price.  For a long time the Johnson family has been giving away free meals once a year at their flagship restaurant Joe's BBQ, right across the street.  In keeping with that tradition of bringing residents together they are offering a ""Community Dinner"" at Liberty.  The concept being that 30 residents can sign up for a dinner consisting of 5 or more courses including a chef's surprise course.  All for one very affordable price. The community part is that they sit you at a table of 6 or so offering diners an opprutunity to get aquinted with thier neighbors.  The dinner is limited to just 30 people on a frist come, first serve basis. Wonderful idea.  Earlier I was bragging about how good the meatball's are. I understand they have a Meatball sandwich which is not on the menu. Also not on the menu is a breakfast burger which is only served on the week ends between 11 and 1.  Not only does this dish sound wonderful but a menu item that is only available 4 hours a week has a strong allure for me.  While I was leaving I was looking at the pictures on the wall and I noticed that the family was pictured outside of the famous Culinary Institute of America Greystone.   I noticed that my waiter was pictured and after tracking him down again I find out that he was a family member, Willie Johnson, how unpretentious.  So that explains some of the good food. They have a strong background."|review|TxOR39w0Mlbd4h1siXyb_w|0|0|0

0MepUkozmPI0YQp8Bp7p8g|2012-11-13|-2o2aTv3zavo69Ci12znYw|5|"I haven't been to a hookah lounge in AGES, but I know what makes a good vs. mediocre hookah lounge, and this one is GREAT! A friend and I went here on a weekday night. Nice decor and REALLY tasteful furnishings, and appropriate arabic music that's not too loud. Nice tall Egyptian hookahs with propper long-handled hoses - the way things should be! If you go to a hookah lounge and they're short hookahs with dinker hoses, walk out. Hookahmania has arabic-speaking clientele and staff. If you want, the word for thank you is ""shukran.""  OK! In my reviews I like to put a few lines of ""Inside Skinny,"" but here's a good chunk of I.S. from my own knowledge! They offer Al-Fakher, Starbuzz, and one other brand of moassell (""mah-sell"") with a huge variety of flavors. For those in the know, and I don't care what anyone says, the hookah tobacco is NOT called shisha! Anyway, although lots of Al-Fakher flavors were listed, but unfortunately eskandrani apple was not among them. It's my favorite flavor from that brand and it's what put that brand on the map along with the few other ""golden seal"" flavors many years ago when the hookah craze was just starting. When you see ""double apple"" on the list, please remember that it doesn't taste like apple, but more licorice. That flavor was carried on because the Nahkla (far inferior brand) double apple is the classic most popular flavor in Cairo. So if licorice is your thing, double apple is for you.  We ordered a berry-mango mix. Large clay bowl (you could have an orange bowl if you want) that lasted for a good long time even with semi-steady puffing. The coal service was expert of course, and the attendant started the hookah before landing it with us. Everyone is given individually wrapped plastic mouthpieces. The 3 coals are usually placed around the outside rim of the bowl to start and for most of the session. Feel free to scoot them around to a new position on the perimeter (tongs provided) after 30 minutes. If it starts to taste burny, remove the coals and let it sit for a few minutes and then put the coals back on.   There, hookah course in a nutshell!  Service was attentive - coals shifted and replaced, and bowl blown out once per session for you. Drinks are available of course. You can also order food from Mijana, the Lebanese restaurant next door. Mijana is a nice restaurant, so if you want a nice dining experience first, there you go. Haven't been inside, but it looks nice through the window. I think this is the best hookah lounge in town right now, and if I remember, they received a Best Of Phoenix award for just that. I was told they have bellydancers Friday and Saturday nights. So for a true and authentic hookah experience, Hookahmania is the place! I don't think I want a hookah from anywhere else. Remember to tip more than at a restaurant, the employees live on tips! Especially the coal tender / hookah server, he works his ass off."|review|zGz5NI4sscO4_6YYH-qVtA|0|2|0

km3g-wDO2KfhfnTvJrLJig|2014-01-25|2MpKnxggc9tx1jPYqHLlpA|1|The following are the thoughts my wife and I had from dinner @ Papaya Thai in Tempe.  Neither of us were impressed.    1) I ordered the Catfish Panang Curry at Papaya Thai.  The catfish did not taste fresh.  It tasted like it was sitting under heat lamps awaiting someone to order it.  The curry was way too light to be even called curry.  It had no taste.    2) My wife ordered the Tom Yum.  She said the broth tasted like someone just made the broth with some water and medicated oil (like putting Tiger Balm or menthol in hot water and calling it broth).  It did not taste like broth.  The seafood in the Tom Yum was so chewy (like it was totally overcooked).  Also, this particular location is also the same as Saigon Pho.  They have the same kitchen serving both Vietnamese and Thai.  If you try to be everything to everybody, you do not do well in anything.  Either do Vietnamese only, or do Thai only.  Do not try to do both.  Also pare down the menu to what you do well, and what you do best.    The waitress was Vietnamese, as my wife, who is originally from Vietnam, picked up the language they were speaking in the back amongst themselves.  I will not write here what the comments they said in Vietnamese according to what my wife heard.  The comments were less then flattering of the patrons in the restaurant.    Judging from my comments you can pretty much guess that my wife and I will not come back.  We would rather spend our money elsewhere where the food is edible.  The only reason we went there was because of Groupon, and we wanted Thai.|review|7knTjXA1lNJw7AMIIJi4YQ|0|0|0

I found the food to taste very authentic. I've heard so many people say bad things about this place but I can't agree. I used to have some Cuban friends who cooked for me all the time. I didn't recognize the names of the plates but when reading the descriptions, I found many of them to sound just like things I've eaten before that was cooked by my Cuban friend  If I closed my eyes, I honestly would have thought it was homemade by my old friend. The portions were very generous and the service was pretty good. I didn't care for the atmosphere at this location so I'm anxious to try the other location.  Since my friends aren't around anymore, I'm excited that I found a place where I can get authentic tasting Cuban food when I have the craving...  I'll be back.|review|6NXQQUBGpbqagR-Yg_cwKA|3|1|3

While I won't review it each time I come here, I skipped reviewing the last 2 or 3 visits. I love this place...it loves me back.  Owner not there today, service spot on and food, well I keep trying something new each time and each time a touchdown. Every table in the place occupied. Every time I have been there, it's been SRO. I don't think that this place is a secret.  Besides the egg rolls (hard to skip this and I just don't love sweet potatoes), today I went for the BÚN RÊU, blue crab meat, eggs, tomato and vermicelli noodles in a chicken broth...and of course a mango boba.  All of my previous forays into Vietnamese have been rice noodles and reading other reviews about pho induced coma's seemed silly to me. Well, this wasn't a pho but 30 minutes later I just wanted to curl up and go to bed - I think the vermicelli had something to do with that.  I love the fact that I could meet Scott W there, the same service, similar food (he had the beef/shrimp pho) and he gives it 3 stars and I give it 5. Different strokes for different folks I guess. I should have told him that he could get wooden disposable chopsticks instead of the nice round plastic chopsticks and perhaps he would have given it 4 stars...|review|55ecDCpJIXzTWjEzMQ11Vg|3|4|4

There is an outdoor bar with surrounding tables but I didn't notice any tv screens outside.  The seats @ the indoor bar suck, so I lobbied for a booth.  (The bar seats were like retro, high chairs that lacked a back you could lean into a lil too high, even for my legs).  Happy hour included a few 1/2 priced appetizers that the waitress highlighted.  She also provided a thorough explanation of speechless communication that would ensure our miller lites continued.  If you face the empty bottle @ the end of the table with the label facing outward, she'd pick up the empties for replacement.  I only forgot about this rule once & received a fresh bottle while I still had a 1/4 bottle left.  No clue how much the beers were but the deal seemed pretty good, since we had @ least 10 beers & an appetizer for $30.  The folks there seemed to run a tidy & expedient little operation and overall my experience was a'ight.|review|9v8IyMk_S6eJujux1Cno7g|1|0|1
_AvHni-xdRHmZ3XfYHwGkg|2010-01-09|doB3AKINVh3Y4HKbISv0qQ|5|What a meal! My wife and I decided to try this place out. I had the 6 course, she had the 5 course. The first course is always a salad or soup, the last is always a dessert. Thus, I had 4 dishes coming to me, she had 3. You simply cross off what you don't want on the list of items that they have tonight. Then you mention how you like food prepared and they think of the rest.  My four were a scallop dish, a baby octopus dish, a uni (sea urchin) mousse type thing, and a seared lamb dish. Dessert was a raspberry bomb. Everything I had was awesome. The chef does a wonderful job of combining sweet with salty. The flavors were very unique.  My wife had big eye tuna with sriracha sauce, a duck dish with light pasta and a beef dish. She never orders red meat, but she devoured the beef. Her dessert was chocolate cubes with salt sprinkled on top with a olive oil drizzle. Never would have thought to combine those three things but it was great.  I suggest sitting at the chef's counter. It allows you to look at everyone preparing dinner, and gives you a chance to interact with Josh, the head chef/owner. If you are a foodie, being able to ask the chef questions and getting his take on the food helps make your meal.  Dinner for two ran us $145, before tip. I had 2 beers, my wife had iced tea. No wine.|review|o3IIbUN5_59PEpD_N8hhhw|0|0|1

It was the middle of the afternoon and after walking in I felt like i had entered a geriatrics ward, we were the only two people in the place besides the staff that was under 40.  My friend got the wraps which were so bad she could not even eat them, so our server removed them from our bill, I got the chicken club sandwich with pasta salad and iced tea.   Our service for the most part was pretty bad, we had like 5 different people come to our table when we were there, not a 100 percent on who our server actually was, but we would ask one person for a refill and they would say sure then someone else would come back with no drink refill.

It didn't remind me at all of what I used to eat as a kid on the beach in New Jersey.  We were offered samples and tried - marshmallow peanut butter (tasted like air with little balls of peanut butter), pink lemonade (blech) and blue raspberry (boring!).  We were going to order something as we had the Entertainment Coupons.  One was for a free medium size ice and the other was buy one get one.  So for less then $3 we got 3 ices.  I ordered honeydew and then asked what the most popular flavor was.  I was told mango by the two employees.  So I had them top it with mango.  I didn't like the mango AT ALL.  Because it was layered though and I am now in my car I have to eat all of it to even get to the honeydew flavor I wanted.  What a disappointment.  It also was yucky.

Yes I was given a lot of excuses that at first I believed, like I said, Nicole is very experienced with many sad stories about why and how she can accept your money but can not perform the service for month and month and can not return calls when promised.    If I was the only person that had a poor experience with this business and this person I would just forget about the $120 I was scammed out of but when I called Living Social the customer serve person expressed the idea there were a lot of complaints.

This is the most magical ""grocery"" experience, I've ever had. I'm air quoting grocery because this place is so much more than just a grocery store.  The variety of offerings here... is mind bottling. For starters, the produce section... I've never seen so many different mushrooms in one place. Mushrooms aren't your thing?   Ok... go to the bakery. Enough delicious looking offerings to rot you teeth out of your face in 5 minutes. Huh? You don't eat sweets?   Ok... check out the area where they fill growlers with beer. Yeah, I said it. They have growlers and a little bar-esque sitting area where you can sample the beers they have on tap.   A salad bar. An olive bar. Deli. Beautiful floral area. Wine. Liquor. A jewelry store. You can even buy groceries if you want.   There are rows and rows of... everything. I didn't even have the energy to go through the entire store. I barely made it out of the bakery.   The store is clean. Aesthetically... well let's just say it's lovely. Absolutely the prettiest, most well organized store I've ever seen. Anywhere. On the planet Earth (I've never been to another planet).   If you've read this far and nothing has made you say, Like Whoa, I need to check this place out... Well... then I'm not properly communicating this Fry's' awesomeness, or we probably shouldn't be friends."|review|7e1XAK4j95x-ibEy4qFKYg|2|2|2

But anyways I gave this place 1 star because I couldnt give it 0, My husband ordered a steak and it was so full of gristle, fat and nerves that on his second bite he started to choke,I totally freaked out and he tried to drink some water and it couldnt go down his throat so he threw it up all over his plate and food,now the steak slipped down a bit so he could breath but it was still lodged there so he was in alot of pain and he kept trowing up.anyways the waitresses were just standing around watching the whole time and after the worst was over they came over and were like are you ok? to my husband.....no im not ok and i need to go to the hospital! the waitress was like ok and she actually went and got our CHECK! like are you kidding me? we just got our food and took a few bites and my hubby chokes on the food you served him and now you want us to pay for it before we rush to the hospital? so the hubby and kids went to the car and I was so mad I just paid and ran out...no manager no nothing. got hubbs to the er and they had to give him some shot to let the steak pass through this throat...you could actually see the lump in his throat! needless to say we wrote a letter to the corporate office and what did they do? oh they sent us a letter saying sorry! will never go here again.......EVER!|review|9Y_dFb_4_43plD8B7IHOOw|1|2|1

Amazing servers really know their business and can recommend wine pairings and their favorite dishes.   The new location in Old Town Scottsdale is more convenient to where we live, though we were just as happy to drive a bit further to the original location. I've chosen ""dressy"" and ""not"" good for kids, only based on how we like to experience Marcellino's, though they are so welcoming and comfortable I'm sure casual dress and (well behaved!) kids would be just as welcome... if you tend to spoil your kids, that is."|review|cl9ZMopdCQGGXMlwgruFdg|0|0|1

I wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese, it was too processed for my liking but I did like the sandwich, the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing.  I would likely return to have that sandwich again.

My son's blackberry ginger ale was good it was 25oz for 2.99 where as regular sodas are 2.59 after tax she told me but I guess she forgot to tell me it does not come with refills like the regular soft drinks do. My son is 13 years & 11mths He gets a soda 2 times a month so yea it kinda pissed me off that I paid almost the same price for 1. The steak had ZERO seasoning, The artichoke appetizer was kinda bland the green sauce that came with it was nasty but the white one was ok, It must be noted my son loved the green sauce. We asked for extra butter & sour cream for both of our baked potatoes & as she turned around half way through our request she didnt hear the for both part & only brought 1 side each. At that point we were pretty pissed & just asked for to go boxes. They had a radio special going for the campfire combo which eliminated our ability to use our coupon for a free app. The waitress told us the blue cheese wedge salad was life-changing.... um no, not even a little bit.

I decided to try the 4 Piece chicken dinner, and was pleasantly surprised. While I waited for my dinner to be ready, I noticed another gentleman order some BBQ (I believe Tri-tip) that looked quite good and I believe I will stop in for that in the near future.  As for my meal, I was really impressed with the quality of the chicken. The breast was really juicy and tender, and the dark pieces, while smaller than what you might expect, were exceptional. The size of the dark pieces really speaks to quality chicken, in my opinion - the way chicken is actually supposed to be. The sides were good but not memorable, though I only tried the corn on the cob and the broasted potatoes. The potatoes were a smaller order than I expected, and I'll probably be giving the baked beans and mac and cheese a try next time.  The venue itself isn't much to look at, but the pricing is quite good for the fried chicken and defiantly something I would give a second try, as well as encourage my friends and family to visit.|review|-nkYxSyYTQNIlj_D3fJGag|0|0|0

The shmears are good, the bagels are fresh, and the sandwiches are filling. So, I must let you know this review applies only to this Einstein's.  I've come here quite a few times, but finally decided to write a review because I'm sick of the mistakes - it needs to be said. At any fast(ish) food restaurant, there is always an expectation of some mistakes being made on your food. But when those mistakes are continually made and cost you extra money...you start getting fed up.  I've had certain staff members screw up my order every time they make it. This is very frustrating, especially when you order cream-cheese (at something like $1.50 extra..which is kinda ridiculous in the first place) and you don't get it with your food, it's infuriating. When you often get your food to go, you don't realize until you reach your destination and it is too late by then. You always have to check your order after leaving Taco Bell, but I thought Einsteins was a little higher than that - apparently not this one.  However, there is one shining star - Cathrin. If everybody made your order as quickly or perfectly as her, this place would be getting a much higher rating from me.  So, if you are going to this location, I warn you. Some of the employees don't pay attention.|review|7o7MF9B9lxcWupE8jiLOaQ|0|0|2

Share that I didn't and that their call system forwarded me along as AAA chose; probably because I still use my cell number from Colorado.  She says she will forward me to someone who can help with my password (in a rude tone).  I get an AAA travel agent (?!) who, predictably, tells me he can't help but that he will forward me to the web team.

So, I call the other number on my card with my irritation level rising.  I share that I've been forwarded twice, hung up on once, and she's my fourth point of contact.  She says she can't help me since she's in Colorado.  But, she offers to hang on after I am forwarded to ensure I get someone.  I get another lady who says she can't help me and that I need to call... wait for it... the 1-800 number.  So, I share that I am now interested in canceling my membership.  Oddly, she was very quick and able with that.  So, I am now an ex-AAA member.  These people really need to get their interstate processes, call-forwarding, and IVR systems straight.

DcrM4hwDcU2G6vuh2cnaYQ|2011-02-14|E8RdhpeVI8e3eg1F3UWUnA|5|I have been wanting to try Noca for quite a while now, so when they had a Groupon a few weeks ago I bought one & decided this would be our Valentine's day date destination. I made reservations for Saturday the 12th at 8:30pm. We were about 15 minuets late, but the hostess was very gracious & seated us immediately. We were sat at a high top table with a chair on 1 side & a booth on the other. There wasn't much going on with the design of the restaurant, but I did like the mirrors across from us & the lighting fixtures. I also liked the faucets in the bathrooms.   For starters we ordered the mussels, our server said it was more of a one person dish so we each got our own. They were delicious & he was right, we both finished ours. I ordered the nocarita to sip on & my husband surprisingly opted for a sprite. My cocktail was strong but tasty. Our 1st Amuse Bouche of the night, a bite of what tasted like cucumbers & radish. It was light & refreshing. The server who brought it out did describe it, but it was so loud in there we honestly didn't hear him. Our 2nd was a cute lil teacup of parsnip soup. It was creamy & smooth, I loved it! My hubby wouldn't even try it though, so I gladly had both of ours. I almost forgot to mention the bread & olive oil that came before our app, very basic but very good.  About an hour had passed from when we had received our app. I didn't notice the length of time, but my husband made a comment to me about how long we'd been waiting for our entrees. A few minutes later our server came up to us apologizing for the wait. He informed us that dinner was on the house tonight & gave us back our Groupon to use another time. I told him I could see that they were very busy & they didn't have to comp our dinner for us, but he insisted. He then brought out a fresh crab cake of sorts with strawberries & a cilantro drizzle, to nibble on while we waited for our entrees.   About 15 minutes later our entrees arrived. My hubby ordered the prime hangar steak & I ordered the striped bass. Both were superb but I think I had the winner. We were already pretty full from all the previously mentioned food we ate, so we took a majority of our entrees to go. I was going to skip dessert since I was already stuffed & I knew we'd be getting some cotton candy, but our server convinced me & I got the doughnuts to go. They were pretty good & I loved the dipping sauces. The cotton candy was a blue-raspberry flavor & my husband loved it, such a fun, sweet end to our meal. Oh & they also handed out tiny shortbread cookies, which were buttery & slightly crunchy, yum!   If our meal hadn't been taken care of, the total would have been about $111. Service throughout our meal was outstanding, I don't think our water glasses were ever less than half full. We left our server a tip that was probably more than most would have left, but he was great & it wasn't his fault our meal tickets were misplaced. I can't wait to return with my Groupon for another amazing meal, well done Noca!|review|33vUIil_GCaT92aUaZhRXA|11|8|10

Late Tues afternoon I spoke w Mark which anticipated the work would be complete by Wed. Late afternoon Wed I hadn't heard anything and I followed up w a call. Nick returned the call Thurs morning and scheduled a time a couple of hours later. Around 3PM Nick called and informed me the windshield wasn't in stock and scheduled a time for 10AM Fri. John came to my residence Fri morning. He was friendly, informative, and the work was done in less than an hour. Mark, on day 1, called State Farm, with me on the phone, and took care of the insurance side of things. No cost to me as I have full coverage. The process was quite easy just bumpy getting scheduled. All appears to be good with the new windshield. I learned of them through Arizona Car Wash on Pima & 90th which. I believe they are contracted with AZ Car Wash.|review|yZjK443FYeBJXmtB8HxrHQ|0|0|1

I've only ever been here to meet up with friends at night - and it's definitely not a place I would choose to go to on my own. The layout is weird - I've I dig the patio, but to have the VIP seating smack dab in the middle of the room and right where you walk in causes a lot of crowding by the entrance. And then the dance floor is always hard to get to when the place is filled. But I don't think I'd want to hang out there anyway - there's always some slightly overweight and drably dressed women dancing up on the platform. I'm in no way considering myself dance club elite or a Scottsdale Snob, but I go out in Scottsdale as opposed to Tempe because I've grown out of that college kid scene, but I guess Scottsdale still thinks it's cool.  As for the drinks, nothing special. Although I found it strange that they used plastic party cups when serving pitchers of beer. This place reeks of the shoddy clubs you can find on Mill during the semester. There are definitely better places to go in Old Town.

The waitress was very charming and when I told her what  wanted and she said she would make it medium and bring me some chili sauce if I wanted it spicier.

I was so sad when Cheuvront closed down because I thought I would never get the chance.  Pizza People Pub renewed my hope in my long lost dream! Not only is the location wonderful, but the food here is excellent. As soon as I glanced over the menu I knew instantly that I would have to make a return trip - the choices are plentiful and each item looks amazing! This time around, we opted to split the smoky paprika Mac n cheese mini, and we each got our own pizza. I got the Kauai Not pizza (basic Hawaiian) and my husband got the Testosteroni. Very very good! Basic, thin crust with good quality toppings- although my pineapples tasted like they might have been the canned variety. But either way, it was good. The Mac n cheese was probably the highlight for both of us - it was baked in a little tin to crispy perfection on top with a creamy interior. The alcohol selection was good here, and I loved sitting out on the patio watching the light rail go by! Especially in the cooler weather and being so close to our house, this will become a go-to spot for sure!"|review|lOvgjEkecLfVJwJriEjt2w|1|0|1

In addition to several TVs placed around the bar, there's plenty of pool tables, dart tables, and shuffleboards to keep everyone entertained.   The menu is big for a bar. The odd, also very good, part about that menu is the salad selection. Duke's has two pages of its menu dedicated to salads. While not something you'd expect from a sports bar, it's nice to know that there still is a healthy selection I can choose from while watching a game.  Another cool feature is Duke's ""No DUI Car.""

First off, the place is gorgeous, beautifully, minimally designed with lovely fireplaces and firepits at just the right spots.  The margarita I drank was very good, nothing outstanding. In Arizona, you better make a better-than-decent margarita or the sheer volume of competition will run you over.  Our friends who live there ordered their usual, the Monterrey, and they loved it. I had one of the restaurant's specialties --- Ribeye Cascabel --- and I was greatly disappointed.  First off, the ribeye is supposed to be one of the most tender cuts of meat from the animal, but nobody told these guys. This was an overcooked, tough piece that was chewy, chewy, chewy. And the cascabel sauce it was supposed to be ""basted"" in, well, bathed is more like it. Swimming? Drowning? And the sauce was all pepper, no subtlety; two bites into it and my tongue, mouth and lips were burning.  They charge $24? For this? ""Meh"" indeed.  We didn't stay for dessert and frankly, I wouldn't go back. C'mon, with all the ""gourmet"" Mexican available in the Phoenix area, why bother with this place?"|review|YZo-_Zo6vSSbWbGjgW5nYQ|0|0|1
9e4-DYABr1mVEw85ErdBMw|2012-08-24|krY06GkWncCzQgOV1KdH1w|2|This is a last resort store now.  We've been shopping here off and on for several years... and since the remodel it's almost impossible to navigate the store.  Their re-model made the aisles much smaller than they were before.  Now you can only fit 2 carts next to each other at a max. There are tons of stacks of random food/items in each aisle - another thing to avoid hitting.    This Fry's is always out of so many things: organic milk, organic produce, cheese and the selection changes it seems weekly. I think they now carry less than they did before the remodel and now they just have larger quantities of certain items.  5 rows of ketchup in 3 different size but no Ken's sun-dried tomato salad dressing...?  Also they re-modeled the produce area... again... and now it's harder to find items, bags and where the labels are with pricing etc.   That and they got rid of the nice greeter who was there for years. I mean, you're doing poorly so instead of listening to your customers about why they don't shop here anymore they fire the greeters? Logical.. obviously.   Since it's 'hit or miss' with this store I've been shopping a lot elsewhere where I know they will have certain staple foods(milk) in stock.   That and the crowd... I'm not sure if it's because it's a Fry's or Kroger but sometime when I'm here I feel like I'm in a Walmart. I understand if you just got out of the pool and are stopping by for a quick item or two... but put pants and a shirt on first.|review|ZZpXfbQn0nU22OGDW15TRA|0|0|0

I worked with Todd, the owner, ahead of time to prepare a menu for 15 people. He was very responsive and worked hard to make sure we were all satisfied in the end.  Some highlights:  Fluke crudo - fresh and refreshing. Paired with grapefruit which added a bit of (welcomed) acidity to the fish  Seabass - served with  a butternut risotto which was just fantastic. Not creamy and heavy like most risottos. The carrots and leeks were also cooked to perfection.    Sticky Toffee Date Cake - yum. very strong flavors...and I thought the whipped cream served with it was ice cream! What a great way to end the meal.  The wine shop next door is such a good idea. The selection is decent and its pretty easy to pick a bottle or two out and walk through the doors and be seated. Service is great, the waitstaff is friendly and attentive.

It is a fairly small place and when we got there the bar was full so we had to sit at a table.  The happy hour menu is decent- better then most sushi bars.  There was a pretty broad range of rolls and apps on it to choose from.  The drinks are a great deal- large size beer for $4.   On to the food.  We started out with the edamame and were surprised at how small a portion it was.  Much smaller then normal.  We also got the goyza which was tasty but not any thing out of the ordinary.  We got a salmon and crazy roll.  I wasn't ""crazy"" about the crazy roll but I'm not a huge fan of rolls and rolls with cream cheese.  We also got the assorted sashimi on the menu.  All the fish tasted fresh except for one of the black cod.  Maybe I just don't care for that one.  I would come back and give this another try.

Hey Management, here's a few pointers for you:  When there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.  We rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.    $12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.    The seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have ""servers"" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.  I won't be going back anytime soon."|review|66tWp8ThwPATFUxYNPyYLw|0|1|1

I called roadside assistance and they asked where I wanted the bike towed. Being new to AZ I said I didn't know and the operator helping me gave me D&Ds info. I called them and they quoted me a price that seemed reasonable. The man I spoke to was polite and patient on the phone and I told him I'd be showing up in a little bit. I hung up and checked yelp just to be on the safe side. I called the almost equally close by Honda motorcycle dealer to see what they'd quote me- almost double- and they were already trying to get me to pay for other services and upgrades without ever even seeing me or my bike! I directed the tow truck driver (another 5 star service) to D&Ds. Less than hour later, Mel had me sorted out, replaced the inner tube for a third of what the original quote was, and didn't try to pull any fast moves. Mel explained that he believed in honesty and professionalism and in being friendly. Seemed like a great guy with a thriving business built on real values. I'll give those guys my money twice on Sunday. They're a full service shop and he said real busy once the snowbirds arrive, so get your servicing done now.

Nice that they had a full bar of course.  : )  The best part was the quality of the dishes though.  Very tasty meals, and I enjoyed the orange chicken.

I would say that time has treated the Green House well. It has really found its groove. I have dined here before and this was the best experience so far.   The menu is varied with options and price points. We were with a group of six and everyone was surprisingly happy with every dish. I had the beet salad and unlike others I have had, this one had about 6-8 small roasted beets chock full of flavor. The greens were plentiful!! A large plate full and the goat cheese and pistachios added nice texture. Not sure how they prepared the goat cheese...it was almost the consistency of a mascarpone, yummy! Others at the table LOVED the ahi tacos and tortilla soup.   I had scallops as my main course and they were cooked perfectly! A great sear on the outside yet tender inside. The julienned peas were really fresh and complimented the dish nicely. The only thing out of place was a crispy piece of bacon on top. The bacon seemed out of place and really unnecessary (albeit perfectly cooked...so much so a lot of breakfast joints should take notice.) Others loved the trout and homemade pasta. Everything seemed light, with a CA flair.   Oh, and the wine list is reasonable too. Only two bottles over $50 and many in the $20 range.|review|OmnXoXdLsXhOVHQCDX_nAw|0|0|0

My favorite thing here were the biscuits.  They were addictive! The Dixie Sweet Tea was good!  I did not like the Flame Roasted Artichoke app.  It was really dry and had no seasoning.  I expected it to be meatier (like the way artichoke is in a dip).  The Southern Fried Okra and Fried Green Tomatoes were a little too greasy for my taste.  More breading would have set them off!   My friends said the wings were just ok, they needed more sauce on them.  My friend's mom had the Grilled Salmon; she said she enjoyed it.  My friend said his Po Boy Sandwich was ""ok"".  He went to school in New Orleans so he had high expectations. For dessert, I had the Snickers Ice Cream Pie. I was pretty underwhelmed.  It had a somewhat gritty texture, too many peanuts and was soupy.  I wanted to score Lucille's higher but too many ""OKs"" across the board.  No one was excited about their dishes.  And to me BBQ (with creole/cajun influence) is definitely supposed to be exciting! The pluses: Nice servers, the portions are very generous and as I mentioned before, we really enjoyed the biscuits."|review|K0euQLFAcKhQPZ6JxGAryg|1|0|1

I said well my family is coming to town and I wanted to check out the resort, the bulldog at the gate at the gate insisted that if I did not know anybody staying at the resort I could not come in. Then he asked for my families name, I a fit of confusion I said 'huh, what, why, ummm I guess I'll turn around' 'yeah turn around please...and as I was pulling away the gate keeper said something that I didn't catch that sounded pretty snooty.

This morning I had to run to the grocery store to pick a few things and decided to get some major points with the BF by bringing home a breakfast burrito!  I got there around 8:20 and saw on the door that Los Taquitos doesn't open until 9 on Sunday.  No biggie, I thought.  It should be around 9 by the time I'm done at the store.  So I take my time browsing the grocery aisles to ensure a 9 am departure.  Walk in the door of Los Taquitos at 9:00 exactly and am successful in getting order #1 for the day!  Chorizo and potato for him, tacos for me.  As much as I love the breakfast burritos, I find them a little too heavy for me first thing in the morning.  So I started getting two tacos instead.  Usually, I get one carne asada and one chicken, on corn tortillas, of course!  The meat is delicious, the taco is tasty, and it's a perfect way to indulge in the goodness of Los Taquitos without feeling like I need a nap right after breakfast.  The service is quick and friendly, the place is clean, and the salsa is good (I prefer the green over the red, or both)!  As Guy says ""winner, winner, chicken dinner!""  Well, I know he isn't the only one that says that . . . but he does work it in quite often!  Ok, and this isn't exactly a chicken dinner . . . but, you get the point, right?  Just go to Los Taquitos! =)"|review|AirVzN1BVQBmq5zY0YMNYQ|2|2|1

The food is good; the wings are pretty much perfect and the pizza is good.  My complaint, though, is that the pizza is ridiculously greasy. I could probably soak it up into 5 napkins for one piece of pizza.  Every time I have ever been here the staff has been really nice. They are pretty good about keeping it clean in there.

A buy 1 get 1 free certainly helps!  The burrito is average, but the meat is a bit chewy and salty (chicken and beef)  The quality of meat was the problem I had with my previous burrito and not much has changed in the many years since my last visit to a Chipotle. .  For similar chain burrito places, Chipotle ranks above Moes, but is behind Baja Fresh, Qdoba etc.   Our table had chips and guacamole. The guacamole was excellent!

The beef was super tender and juicy and the fries were some of the best I've ever had (they're battered and very crispy).  The downfall is that this is somewhat of a cafeteria environment (noisy and you stand in line to get your food) and they still charge nearly $12 for a sandwich, side, and soda. I was also not asked to pick my side - I wanted soup - but they threw the fries on there without asking. While the food was delicious, it was overpriced with mediocre service. I might go back but it's unlikely.|review|o8J-ergbGYjrUy85I_rxzw|0|0|2

You will run into the snobby one every now and then, but hey they calm down after a bit of slobber and dog hair clings to their fancy clothes.

The cashiers are always friendly whether it be 4pm or 11pm. One of the night manager's is especially friendly and I will have to get his name on my next visit so I can update it on here. He deserves a call out for good service.  One of the cashiers named Cat is also especially helpful and friendly.

First of all, the drive up there, in a manual, almost gave my boyfriend a heart attack!! The random useless signs that ""try"" to direct you to your destination are more in the way than they are helpful!   After we FINALLY get to the top, we are greeted by a couple of very nice, and well dressed young men who politely direct you to the restaurant. This place is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend that everyone eat here at least once. Once we got up, past the lounge area, to the receptionist we of course received a bit of attitude. (happens all the time)  My boyfriend and I like to eat out a lot, since we haven't the time to cook for ourselves, and since we both are only 19 and look quite young, we tend to run into people who assume that we are the ""typical"" teenagers. You know, rowdy, cheap and obnoxious. Either that or spoiled because of how expensive this place is.   Anyways, after the receptionist barely acknowledged our presence, we were sat in a booth, far from the huge glass windows. I really wish we were closer, but a booth for a romantic dinner is probably the best way to go. Once we got seated, we were addressed by an older man, who definitely did not seem happy with his new table. His introduction was short and sweet. Since the menu was pre fixed, he suggested that we order one of each option so that we may try everything. I can at least thank him for that.   The biggest issue that I had, really didn't have anything to do with the restaurant. There was a couple sitting next to us in another booth, practically having sex!   Back to the topic, the service after we ordered was very disappointing. We had waaay too many people waiting on us. We had the main server, and 3 food runners/bussers. So we were constantly interrupted.   The food was delicious though, and the presentation was phenomenal. Definitely have to make a reservation here.  Our bill came out to be about 230, and then a 60 dollar tip, so 290 total.  Be prepared to spend."|review|1IRyTTXa__KRxhxnz8fS5w|0|2|0

Not the typical frames you see on each persons face when passing by on the street. I enjoy unique frames that fit my face but also give a different look. Now if your shopping for frames that have a different style both shapes and colors you need to set your eyes on this store. The small boutique is located at the Biltmore Fashion Park in the Union Shopping center. There are a wide variety of styles to choose from so even the pickiest shoppers can find something to fit their face. I have to say this not your ordinary sunglasses store because they offer brands, styles (including vintage) and colors I have not seen in the valley. For a person who has a large collection of sunglasses I was highly impressed with the brands they carried and the selection to choose from. Living in the valley of the sun it is important for me to protect my eyes. It is nice to know I have a new local store to help keep me healthy while looking trendy.

SgGINtDKQgoXoAnQgrDKDg|2008-04-11|MbxFmKNyJsE4XOXA5LZZRw|3|I think this is the Native New Yorker that hits its demographic and executes its concept the best in the Valley.  After all, It is JUST a simple sports bar, with plenty of HD screens in good angles, beer specials and very good wings.  They maintain the feeling of a gamewatch spot better than the Mesa location, which appears to be more of a family dining spot, and reduce the frat-bar vibe of the Tempe location.   I would consider NNY's wings the best in the valley for anyplace NOT names Hazlewood's.  They have a great flavor, but they tend to mix in a few small afterbirth rejects into your basket and count them as one of your dozen.  No fair.  There is no reason to rush out and get to this NNY location if there is one by you, but if you are in Sprawltukee, its a more-than-suitable place to stop by for a serious game watch.  *Side note:  everytime I've watched a game of personal importance here, my rooting interest has lost.

As some reviewers have noted there isn't a clubhouse so Vista Verde will not, at least at this juncture, give you the amenities and experience of a country club like most Scottsdale-area public courses. But.... playing the course more than makes up for that.  This past Saturday was the third time I have played the course and I expected my round to dampen somewhat my previous high appreciation for this course.  Instead it reinforced my belief that for the price point, course quality and playing experience at Vista Verde really are unmatched.  The course won't ""wow"" you as much Troon North or Eagle Mountain, each with their scenic vistas but it's packed with enough variety to impress even the most experienced of desert golfers.  Vista gives the golfer a number of long and short par 4s, including a risk-reward driveable par 4 on the front that can easily turn a sure par into a double bogey disaster.  A long and difficult par 5 highlights the back nine with the par 3s providing relief from the numerous and difficult par 4s that populate this course.  On this particular day, as with every previous time I've played this course, the tee boxes were well maintained, the fairways lush and delineated and the greens fast and very difficult.  The staff is extremely helpful and your cart is equipped with ice and bottled water at the beginning of the round.  By far, Vista Verde is my favorite course for all of the reasons above.  Highly recommended for the local or golf vacationer."|review|uGsLHgjymay8x-kJJU2PrA|1|1|1

Maroon bricks, wall sconces with candles, decadent chrystal chandeliers, heavy red velvet curtains finished with gold tassels, dark brown studded leather armchairs, marble tabletops and bar, and a bookcase with classics such as ""Moby Dick,"" make this bar and lounge seem like it should be popping up somewhere in Amsterdam, not Old Town.  Otis redding, Marvin Gaye, and Ben E. King pipes from the speakers, it sets the mood for something sexy....perhaps some delectable nibbles while you ply your date with drinks.  This is the kind of place that I believe Hemingway would frequent,  I think it should be called Hemingway's...  In turn, I began our trip with the aptly named ""Hemingway Daiquiri"" (Bacardi silver, fresh grapefruit and lime juice with maraschino liquor and simple syrup) which sounded good for the feminine palate, but tasted like an 80 proof man pour.  The cocktail menu definitely features some very robust concoctions...I think I will stick with their wine menu.  We ordered the deviled eggs with caviar.  Deviled eggs?  Something I have never seen on a restaurant menu - but something which has appeared at countless potlucks and BBQs over the decades.  Therefore, it was ordered purely for its audicity to appear here.  With caviar, no less.  And we were not disappointed by this flavor combination.  But the fun didn't stop there.  Immediately following came the Seared Scallops with Gremolata.  Divine!  Heavenly!  That gremolata was so superb that I wanted to rush out to a neighboring supermarket and buy bread just so I could soak it all up.  That, or I could have just licked the plate clean...  (Side note...there is no bread to be found at Mabel's, so come prepared next time)  And then came another blissful dish, the Bluefin Tuna Carpaccio, with blood orange and yuzu.  Generous helpings of finely sliced tuna, marinated and doused with the lemony tart stylings of the yuzu and the bittersweet kick of blood orange.  Absolutely beautiful.  And last but not least came the glazed pork belly.  It was like a gourmet version of the pork rind, the perfect bar food, so sinful and so rich!  At the time we were there, the night was young and it was early in the week.  Just a few regulars sat at the bar, but I have been here on weekends where the lounge is alive with patrons swilling cocktails, watching the game on the plasma screen, or having a private soiree in the secret room, which is accessed by way of the Batman-esque revolving door bookcase.  Inside you will find one window, which affords a view of the lounge, but appears as a mirror to the guests gathered in the bar.

Whenever I'm back in town visiting my parents, it's a pleasure to come back to Copper Star Coffee.  Part of the reason to head to Copper Star is the ambiance: it's a converted vintage gas station with a quirky, welcoming feel. Light streams in through the glass-paneled garage door and, with the cafe's tall ceilings, the space feels at once very large and very cozy. I've come here to work the past, but unlike some coffee shops, Copper Star is never completely overrun by laptops. There are always pairs or groups of friends here having a good time. Nevertheless, if productivity is what you want, the shop is never too loud, there's free WiFi, and there are a couple plugs along the west wall. I've definitely had some productive afternoons tinkering away at one of their long communal tables.   The quality of service at Copper Star has consistently been excellent. The folks are nice, approachable, and ready to help, and interacting with them has always been a joy. The coffee is good -- I'm a no-fuss, black coffee girl, but trust them about the iced cappuccino on really hot days -- and, if you're more of a tea person, they're one of the few places nearby that stock Harney & Sons, one of my favorite tea blenders in the US. I've had a couple pastries and the veggie sandwich, and they were delicious.  In sum: If you're a Phoenician in need of a charming, quality coffee shop in your neighborhood to spend time with friends or solo, go to Copper Star.  You're welcome.|review|H00RRKcbJwmAjWLOC3_smQ|0|0|0

Although it didn't seem to fit my gift needs, with so many good reviews, I had to check it out.  The place is VERY unassuming.  Complete hole in the wall.  That is either a very good sign, or a very bad one.  Luckily for me, it was the former.  The man working when I visited (owner?) was very friendly and let me know all of my options.  With limited $$ and belly-room, I knew I would have to come back.  It was the ice cream cookie sandwich promise that drove me there in the first place, so I decided to satisfy that on this trip.  The cookies are GOOD.  So good!  I actually regret getting the ice cream sandwich because I would have rather focused on the cookie by itself!  Ohhhhhh, *nom*nom*nom*  When I go back, I think I'll have to get a cookie and a lemonade.  Or maybe an Italian ice.  Or maybe a fruit smoothie.  So many options!  But I will definitely have the presence of mind to buy some cookies to bring home next time!  Keep in mind there is almost no place to sit.  There was a table with a chair or two inside, and a table with 3 chairs outside.  Not a place to go with a big group of friends and have a sit-down chat.  Please visit!  I love Cookiez and want it to stay around a long time!|review|VocJ2eKCB88wgnM5sw-LNg|0|1|1

The Chandler location can be found just outside the Chandler Fashion Center and sounds like a great place to stop by and have a burger after a long day.  Unfortunately, the menu did not live up to the lovable Dan Majerle. Let's start with the fries. On the menu they are called MegaCrunch Fries but they couldn't have been more bland. Where's the salt? But the fries weren't the worst part of Majerle's. That honor goes to the coleslaw that they must have borrowed from a school cafeteria. If you are planning a visit order something that states on the menu several different toppings! That way you don't have to worry about dying of food boredom.  A much better use of your money would be to head down to Fleming's Steakhouse during their happy hour and trying their Fleming's Prime Burger. It's only 6 bucks during their happy hour from 5-7.  If you were going to hang out with a group of friends for the night and order a lot of beers this might be the place for you if you don't care what you're snacking on in the mean time.  Sorry Dan.|review|gsyguOgT2Dnjw-OYw14XDw|2|0|3

The flavor of the broth is okay, they give you a lot of meat, but I hate how quickly the noodles get soft. I like my noodles a little more al dente.  I don't like the smoothies and milk teas here either, they taste like the powdered kind, and the boba/tapioca balls are always too squishy like they've been sitting in the water for too long (starting to notice a pattern?)

I like the theme of Carlsbad! There menus are original and fun. The servers are EXTREMELY friendly and I was seated promptly, it was a group of 7. I ordered the green chili burger, it's an opens faced burger drenched in green chili. I have to say that it was awesome! The green chili was the perfect amount of hot! Then for desert I had the chocolate bread pudding! It was pretty good, very chocolaty, just wish there was some more sauce on it or something, seemed to be a little dry.

The staff was enthusiastic to help me when they heard it was my first time there, too.

The good - the menu is really creative and brings a bit of sophistication to the Downtown salad and sandwich scene.  Also, the place is cool and airy, hip and comfy.      The bad - we had some service issues.  After being very attentive when we arrived, our waitress forgot that we were on a 45 minute lunch break and left us to languish  (and left our finished burger sitting on the counter staring at us for over 5 minutes).    The cooks forgot to make our second sandwich and fries, and when the waitress went to check on it, the cooks got into a fight that we could hear in the dining room, and one of the cooks stormed out.  We did eventually get fries (albeit not the ones we ordered), but ended up having to get the sandwich to go (b.c we'd already finished sharing the the burger and had to leave to get back to work).  While the burger was fantastic (Wagyu beef with sauteed mushrooms - yum), and the fries were tasty and crispy, the grilled cheese was just a slice of cheddar on some toast (maybe there was a mistake and we got the kiddie version????).  OKAY, so I'm sure you are wondering why I gave them 3 stars and will ever go again . . . because, despite the snafus, the food we did get was really good and the waitress bent over backwards to ""make it right"".  She apologized and kept us informed, she comped some of our food, etc.  So, in the end, she saved us as customers."|review|25oXkBG9aJ6OB0_QL0ujZg|0|0|0

The first thing that we noticed right away was the very small number of people dining here (as compared to their competitors). Service was good - they were very friendly, but when we asked for a menu they immediately pushed us towards the buffet special, saying that the food on the buffet line contained the best items off of their menu. So, we went ahead and gave it a try.   After we were done, we all pretty much came to the same conclusion - mediocre. Nothing really stood out. One of the rice dishes had some kick to it, but otherwise the food was pretty bland for Thai. The quality of the meat/chicken was so-so.   In all fairness, we did not try ordering anything off their menu, so maybe they deserve another shot there. If Thai food is your thing, there are other places in town that run circles around this place (Swaddee Thai & Yupha's Thai).|review|ZCkqYZQL3X1E6RmkK8epSQ|0|0|0

In fact, I liked it so much that it may have colored my opinion on the restaurant quite a bit.   For starters I had the soft pretzels with cheese fondue which was so delicious! You get a basket of large pretzel pieces and a substantial pot of cheese. More than enough for two people!  Then I had the Chicken Gorgonzola salad. It was the perfect cool dish for a hot summer day. I wish it had a few more apple slices in it, but over all it was a great salad with the perfect amount of dressing.   Our waiter was attentive, but it could have been because the restaurant was pretty empty relative to it's size. Although I imagine that it is packed on weekend nights.  I was also pleased that they brought out black napkins for me since I was wearing black pants. It was a thoughtful touch!  I can't wait to go back and try something off of their extensive cocktail menu! Too bad drinking isn't acceptable during working hours!|review|Zkn45PKSC3Lj-o_ZnK35yw|4|3|6

A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.    Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says ""Lunch Specials"" and where it says ""Sandwiches.""  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?    Instead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.    My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.    All in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.    My husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for."|review|vUM21g3cPEdSlI89oDttgw|0|0|1

No greeter, no sign to sit yourself, no nothing. Um..ok. So...what do we do? You need to have someone at the front door at all times...Or at least a sign that says seat yourself.  Sat at the table for 10 minutes. No acknowledgement. No menus. Just a Jamison candle bottle that we played with. Had to ask some random person sweeping if she had menus. Really? Another 10 minutes, what would you like for a drink? Are you our waitress? I don't know if your another sweeper or somebody else playing a joke on us. Acknowledge your table!! How difficult is that? Training of the employees has got to be number one and sadly its the food number one. Bummer.  Maybe it was just a Sunday afternoon kind of thing, but our waitress could care less. First time in here? Thanks for coming back! No questions, no nothing. At least ask my wife...  I really like the food but it does nothing for me when you can't get simple service right. We will not be back. We've had friends that have been there in the last two-3 months and say the same thing. Food is great. Service is horrible. It's not just me saying this.   Fix some things and care a little bit more about your diners...I hope you make it to the 5 year mark. I'm willing to try again but it's got to be better on the 3rd time otherwise your a waste of time.  Two starts cause the food is actually good. -2 cause of the 19 year old waitresses with their junk hanging out of their bras.|review|RzS8kWogWc2HZPUZVWfxfA|0|0|2

I mean, does anything in this city give you that funny, muscle spasm the rest of us recognize as a smile? And really ""too many other places to get coffee in this area?"" Um you do realize we live in Phoenix right? I'm thinking of opening up a cafe myself and calling it ""Not Enough Coffee Places In This Area Megan D!""   I just dropped in for the first time yesterday and christened it with one latte, a three hour writing sesh, a smoke break or two, a little bit of coffee shop eaves dropping and even some hardy conversation with the totally friendly baristas.   The latte was dead on. Smooth and naturally sweet. The ambiance, a calculated balance of place to be seen-idness and just put your headphones on and zone out-ability. And those giant windows, that swirling breeze, the purple and orange sunset, I dare say I want them for my own.    I'll be back soon for sure with a giant muscle spasm on my face."|review|teReqgLIak4hP8be-JQxPA|1|3|0

The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic. Chipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic.  Although the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil. Don't be put off by the lunch line. No matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly. I have spent many lunches here when the line was nearly out the door I was still in and out in a reasonable time. It is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product.|review|CAlxnkAuqNetlUmWtCQ_eQ|3|2|3

It just wasn't worth it.  Plus there is nowhere to park.  If the 5 spots are filled out front, you're screwed due to the poor design and layout of this store, to its parking lot.  Save yourself the trouble.   Go to Costco, Albertsons or Frys and buy one of their pre-made chickens for $5. Shoot...buy 3 of them.   Buy your own sides (Kraft Mac-n-cheese, Bushes baked beans, instant mashed potatoes) and make them yourself.

The location was behind the intersection.   This place close at 10pm which is very helpful for people who hungry after 9pm with a nice price Asian food and fast or ""to-go"" style.  This ""to go"" concept restaurant have few tables for customer who want to eat in there. When you entered the door, you should go straight to the counter, order the foods, pay, and wait for the food.  When the food came to my table, they served with rice without spoon or fork.  It seem they expected all their customer was not a ""first-time"" customer that ""who knows where they put their spoon or fork.""  They didn't say anything until I stand up, asked them, where was the spoon or the fork. They just said, ""Oh, here!"" (It was plastic pork and spoon infront of them which is infront of me on the counter. Gosh, I didn't see that..lol). Well, I expected if you served the food, it should come with fork or spoon, at least. Lol...  You served yourself for the water in the cup on the soda machine.  I ordered beef curry that night. The food taste was average. I found a bloody meat swimming in my curry, so I asked them to cook it back. The guy behind the counter said nothing (not even say sorry or whatsoever).  I might go back to this place if I am  in an ""emergency hungry"" situation such as hungry after 9pm."|review|nP_vZUqkoajeBC4qTV0Mlg|0|0|0

I'm usually at the Biltmore shopping and spending too much money at the Apple Store. So I usually walk on by to head home play with my new toy(s).  So I finally made a conscious effort to go and I was pretty sure upon walking in that I would regret not coming sooner. I had a few drinks at Crush lounge and though tiny, it fit the bill for an actual lounge. So many places call themselves lounges when they're just a bar trying to glorify themselves.  Crush is a true lounge-a small scale version of what you might find at a boutique hotel:intimate, dimly lit, good music and private spaces to enjoy a cocktail with someone special. I have to make it an effort to come here for cocktails more often because the vibe here is usually what I'm looking for-mental note made.  After drinks we took a seat at the Kitchen Bar, where it was awesome to watch Christopher and his team at working creating culinary works of art. I went on a Monday where I was able to take advantage of one of their specials: grilled tenderloin with au gratin potatoes for $20. SCORE!!!!! It was served sliced up and served with a Cabernet reduction which was delicious. I also got to try some mushroom and arugula pizza which was served on such heavenly crust. Everything was c'est magnifique!  I really have to applaud them as well for a top notch wine list. I LOVE South African wine and there are very few places in the U.S. that  feature on their wine list. So as if I wasn't happy enough with my meal and the experience this little extra plus is what earned them five stars in my book.  This is a very nice place and I can't wait to bring my family here. I'm sure a lot of folks may overlook this place if they're busy shopping. If nothing else, stop in for lunch and see why you need ot make it back for dinner."|review|wNqwKWaRjClmcKsoJJRFow|9|8|13

The obvious: These dogs are delicious. Pairing creative, delicious ingredients with Schreiner's products is a no-brainer and the result is one phenomenal hot dog. I've never had a sub par meal at Short Leash, everything is tasty and perfectly cooked every time I receive my order.   What I think should really be mentioned is how good Short Leash is at bouncing back from getting swamped, or making a mistake on an order. When my partner and I placed our orders yesterday, they were knee-deep in orders with a line of 12 people behind us. While we waited, I popped into Urban Cookies for a cupcake, and when I came back out our food was already made and ready to go. Through some miscommunication we received pepper-jack corn dogs instead of the pepper-jack hush puppies we thought we had ordered. The dude handled it like a pro despite being super busy, and was really nice about the whole ordeal. What I thought was going to be at least a 10-minute wait was barely even five. Kudos to the Short Leash team for that, I'm always impressed by how friendly you are despite being stuffed into a tiny truck in 106 degree heat.

As typical of my wife and I, we each ordered something that appealed to us and ate family style. Ordered Kafka sandwich and Beef kabob. The food went over rather well with us, the Beef Kabob used higher grade beef and the Kafka Sandwich had really good flavor. We sat out on the front patio and enjoyed people watching. The waitress was very accommodating to my little girl that just wanted to run around, especially since there was a water fountain to play with close by.  I will say this, the prices almost kept us away, they seemed a bit high for Greek food, but the quality of the food and the nice waitress helped to soften the bill when it arrived.|review|k5b1u7Y3CFJ3oQizpAcrwA|0|0|0

Spacious rooms, great room service.  You can park for free underground.  There are a handful of pools and a deceivingly fast water slide.  Poolside service is great and there are always waitstaff bringing you pitchers of water and ready to take your order.  Get the kobe burger with fries!  There was no steak salad on the poolside menu so I have no idea what the previous reviewers were raving about.  There are also a ton of koi fish in the pond leading to the canyon villas.  If you ask the pool staff, they might let you feed them with what looks like miniature dog food pellets.  Prepare yourself for attack of the monster koi!     There is a super cute ice cream parlor and even a flower shop on the premises.  Loved the hooded bathrobes and generous amenities~    Ix-nay on the following: Paid internet and gym usage.

They recently stopped their happy hour inside, which is one of the reasons that I've downgraded it from a 4-star to a 3-star. They only have it on the patio and the bar, where before they had it all over the restaurant. It's summer; nobody is going to want to sit outside in the baking heat for happy hour when you could go somewhere nearby and get happy hour prices.   My husband and I always get the Aegean club and split it. It's great--chicken, bacon, and gyro meat on pita bread with lettuce, tomato, and onion. Perfection. The red sangria is awesome. My in-laws always get the stuffed peppers, and they are ALSO divine.   The last time we were in, there was live music. The gentleman who was performing was wonderful. It was the only time we'd seen there.   The silverware is often dirty (I've had to exchange mine two of the last three times I've been in) and the service is just okay, but the food makes up for it.

Many complain about the resort fee and the location of the self-parking. I don't love these either, but I think they're immaterial. (More thoughts on the resort fee at the end.)  I have not raised any of the following concerns before this review, because it seems futile. I have never used the pool. Why would I? It and the surroundings are forgettable compared to many relatively pedestrian hotels in the metro area and elsewhere. Also, the chemicals in the hot tub were so strong that they bleached my trunks. The chairs in the room are uncomfortable (and I don't think they are antiques, which might be worth having even if not comfortable). There are some really simple fails that I can't believe the hotel doesn't fix, and the lack of effective response seems to speak to the hotel's lack of concern for guest satisfaction...1. If you can actually get it brewed, the in-room coffee is vile--yes, vile. Remember to bring your own coffee with you, if you like having decent coffee before going out in the morning. 2. The coffee pots are dysfunctional--they get stuck regularly and don't complete brewing; the carafe is practically impossible to remove from the apparatus, which gets messy. 3. Why do the sinks still not have hot water reliably!? When the dust settles, I am still very satisfied at the name your own price rates I have obtained, but I would be irate if I paid what the hotel asks publicly.  As an aside, the hot water at the sink still doesn't work several months after the other review complaining about this issue, and I've stayed in several different rooms at the property. In light of this, the management's repeated cheeky form response (to that reviewer and to other yelpers on different issues) to the effect of ""hope you aired your concerns so they could be addressed while you were there"" seems hollow and phony. Frankly, I didn't need a smoking gun to divine that--it is apparent from the tone of the replies. I don't know why the hotel bothers to respond to these reviews if it's not going to do so effectively; it just makes things worse. I actually felt much better about staying here before I read the management's responses! I would prefer negligence and neglect over calculated disdain. I may share my views with the management via email or in person--hopefully it will go to someone other than the person who apparently monitors yelp.  Here is my longwinded take on the ""resort fee"" (a common theme on this page). It  strikes me as essentially cosmetic for an informed consumer, given that practically all resorts in the local market are charging a similar fee (it's more of an issue when non-resort (in Priceline parlance) hotels charge a ""resort fee""). But that doesn't make it ok. If the fee is per rooms, it should be built into the price. Otherwise, it is annoying. I can only think of two reasons to break it out separately, neither of which inspires confidence from the consumer's point of view. The most likely is that the hotel wants to trick someone who isn't likely to be a repeat customer. The other is to send a signal along the lines of ""we're special, and you're paying more because you're getting more."" (A resort fee is a star on a Sneetch's belly.) This, however, makes absolutely no sense, because resort amenities vary dramatically just like any other hotel amenities, and travelers generally make decisions about how much to pay for hotel-apples and hotel-oranges based on a holistic assessments. Resort amenities are no different from views, location, furnishings, staff, etc. It is obvious that most people don't read disclosures--the goal of most people who write them is to have plausible deniability but not to help the reader. A per person resort fee might make some sense, but that's not how they charge."|review|fvbpKsDJBCCLNCzxkFf0-g|1|0|1
jfiWnT1G0Pzq1PtavVjZaQ|2013-04-02|-ISp7w3PIKoVPnHF-i-SyQ|4|Was originally planning to go to Bison Witches for brunch at 10 am, however Bison wasn't open and C.A.S.A. was. It was perfect. We had a group of 8 or 9 and found a spot that accommodated all of us.  They are also dog friendly :)  I love the patio. They were only serving their limited breakfast menu when we got there but it was great. I don't know who decided to put sweet potatoes in a breakfast burrito but their burritos and breakfast burrito bowls are pretty damn good for a small little patio bar on mill that has only been open for 2 weeks.  I'm looking forward to trying their lunch menu and of course drinks :)  I love that they are open early and I absolutely love patios in AZ this time of year.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they brought me a burrito instead of the bowl that I ordered. The contents are the same and it still tasted really good.|review|9sEISMwGHlbC6LaddU903Q|1|0|0

I went with my brother and a friend.  I had the yakisoba (noodles with vegetable and sauce), my brother had the Udon noodle soup with tofu, and his friend has the tuna.  All three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful.  We couldn't stop raving about the flavor.  Who knew noodles could be so magical or tofu so flavorful?!?  The service was actually quite wonderful.  Our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like.  She also brought us the cool appetizer bread basket...banana bread, little cinnamon toasts, and rolls.  She also helped up each pick a desert :)  Just an odd little place, Japanese and Italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an Eiffel Tower decoration and a bright red British phone booth???  Check it out :)|review|saNCRlGYQEBkgpvalJsvRw|2|0|1
prieQp5JNe6OzdiuMR8dFw|2013-10-20|kOESe829LHqvOLNiRltDwg|4|I had a Great time at the AZ Taco Festival. I mean like Tony the f*cking Tiger Grrrrreat. I may have just been so impressed because the most recent festival I attended was such a dud that it made this one look exponentially better.  We got here early which I think also helped. The parking was smooth and Free. There were no crowds to fight. It was awesome.   The token system used to purchase food and drinks also made everything run smoother than if people were trying to pay by other means at each individual taco booth. Very efficient.  My favorite taco was made by the Tonto Bar & Grill. It was a grass fed bison taco with chile jicama slaw and tepary salsa. Very good.  Monti's Steakhouse made a good beef taco, but what I liked most was their corn tusk taco basket. That was pretty cool.   There was also a unique dessert taco made by Gertrudes. Unfortunately I didn't take a pic... The taco shell was a chocolate (I think) waffle cone. Inside was avocado ice cream and something else... ugh I wish I took a pic. Memory Fail. It was definitely tops for uniqueness though.  I'm right there with Travis B in noticing the lack of veggie taco options. There should have been a few more. They're not necessarily my thing, but if I was a vegetarian, I would have been disappointed.   We didn't hang around for much of the entertainment. It was mostly just a taco devouring expedition. And in that respect the AZ Taco Fest was a complete success.|review|7e1XAK4j95x-ibEy4qFKYg|2|5|2

And they have what I think is the best happy hour menu and drinks in the neighborhood.  Greg makes a great Don Julio skinny margarita!  Also love the carnitas tacos and shrimp cocktail (actually more of a ceviche)  Guitarist tonight playing alt rock tunes.  I'm really digging it!  This place is really growing on me.

In reading Noca's posted on-line menu, we were thrilled to be able to return to this place (this was visit #2) after the maiden voyage was a bit pricey for what was offered. Enter our server...who when asked why the menu in-house was NOT the same as the on-line preview of coming attracttions said ""Oh yeah, we are out of some things."" I don't need to know the behind-the-scene strategy meetings, but something along the line of ""We aren't serving this because of having run out....but this dish is amazing and you will love it!"" would have been something more palatable. The soft shell crab app was wonderful! From there, things became wayy more pedestrian and uninteresting, The pork dish was unseasoned and was the definition of ""big plate, small food."" Had it been stellar, things might have been  ok....but this was a tasting portion size. A single meatball was another course. I can see why the server suggested a flat bread side...to help with the munchies. Dessert was ok...I mean really... Tracey Dempsey can do little wrong in my book, but sadly the tone had been set prior to her creations. In a town where there a LOT of excellent restaurants (pork and everything else at Beckett's Table comes to mind), I'm thinking that this is the second strike...and we won't take the chance of a third."|review|S_S06oA6xGAPr-HC1kLVlQ|0|0|0

A lot of other people had this idea too, because not only did we have to park quite a ways away, Chuy's was packed out and we barely grabbed the last table available.    I had an order of two chicken enchiladas ($1.99), my wife had a quesadilla ($1.99) and I got a Baja Brew ($2).  With some guac on the quesadilla, and complimentary chips and salsa, total of less than $8, what a steal!    I was mad when I had the chicken enchiladas...mad that I only ordered one plate!  They were delicious.  I think what put them over the top was the strong mesquite broiled flavor from the chicken.  They were also nice and crisp with a good amount of cheese and sauce.  The quesadilla was okay, nothing special about it, and the chips weren't super fresh.   The beer was cold and had a nice flavor to it.  It had been awhile since I had been here, but I'm going to try to be back again soon for those chicken enchiladas!|review|XpejQYZqVcYGX7fYuYHzSw|0|0|0

ZEuGHuIZfVXU3THVIMys9Q|2013-01-09|5iTOdRj6YXfdbsPUOfPr2A|2|I moved into this building (luckily into a rental) in November. It looks very cute and nice on the outside and my apartment has been updated with vinyl floors that look like hardwood. It also has very cute custom paint on the walls. As it looks very appealing as to the reason I moved in, there has been nothing but issues since I moved in. The walls are thin, so if your neighbors play music, you can definitely hear it easily. Also, the tenant above me has hardwood floors so I can hear them walking back and forth. So far since I've moved in, I believe they have shut the water off at least 10 times to do maintenance. The day I moved in, there was a flood in the club house. There has been a pipe burst outside that flooded the parking lot. Today there was a flood and they had to turn off the water to the whole complex. When I called the emergency after hours line, they said it happened at 2am. It is now almost 7am and they haven't notified anyone by any means of communication that nobody in the building will be able to shower this morning. I've also had a problem with bugs, I have found a few baby cockroaches and centipedes in the unit. I'm a very clean person so the bug problem is a huge surprise to me. I have notified my property manager with the multiple issues as well as the building and it seems its always someone else's problem. In other words (mine, the tenant). Which is B.S. if you ask me. I gave it a two star rating because it does look nice and there is very good security 24 hours a day. If you are thinking about moving in to this building, I hope you read my review and take everything into consideration!|review|e6wxKzkl-xR6dGPBRb-xQQ|0|0|2

JxVGJ9Nly2FFIs_WpJvkug|2013-04-15|0QRXdVoV70LSLNFfiD2Q4g|4|"In the past two weeks, my wife and I have been to this location twice. Both times, we ordered the exact same thing...because it was absolutely delicious!  For our appetizer, we opted for the Caprese Bruschetta. It's topped with mozzarella cheese, and it's perfect for sharing. If I'm not mistaken, it comes in a serving of either 2.5 or 3 pieces.  For our pizza, we decided we would split the Portobello & Artichoke Pizza. It's a thin crust style of pizza topped with...nevermind. You know what's on it.  Again, this pizza was perfect for us to split.  Sauce has a great modern vibe going on inside. It's kind of trendy, mixed with a little hipster. So, it should appeal to many different groups. On our first trip, we sat inside. It was nice to see how the staff were so involved in the entire process. Even though it's not a ""wait service"" type of place, the staff didn't seem to know that. They were constantly policing the dining room, making sure every table was spic and span for the next group that would inevitably be coming in. While doing so, they were also very diligent in making sure that the clientele were being cared for.  On our second outing, we managed to find space on the patio. Each table outside of the natural shadow created by the building's overhang has an umbrella. Though, there are no misters that I saw. Thankfully, we managed to find a couple of tables under the overhang. Therefore it was nice and shaded. As for the rest of the seats, they might be better suited for the cooler months, or in the evening.   For both of us to share an appetizer and a pizza, plus two refillable fountain drinks, we managed to pay around $20. Not bad for such good food and service!"|review|v6rb-4YhADpuD99f3RKmgg|6|3|6

The Bar: lot's of craft beer on tap at a very reasonable price: pints for $5 and schooners for $6.25. They had a fun DJ the night I was there. There was dancing and seating available with an artsy crowd.   The Theater: a quaint theater with about four rows of seats with tables in the back. Tickets were $8 a piece. It was fun to see one of my all time favorites on the big screen! They also show a lot of indy flicks, and sometimes TV shows like the Walking Dead.

She said they probably were and kept ringing me up. I had lots to check out but I knew the price seemed high. She was really concerned about me signing up for rewards. I asked again about checking prices and she said she would in a second.  Well she rung everything up and then I still had to ask about prices. She said oh yeah, what do you want me to check. Just about everything came up wrong and worse I had to dig through the bags to find the items while searched on the register. Then someone had to find the correct item. Complete waste of time.

W6624iddi14DsGokORyzcA|2013-04-17|VWfNkMk_U-8GQa4j-L8Yqw|5|Most authentic Indian food outside of India!  I know, because I've been!   Don't let the idea of  exotic food scare you away...there's something for everyone here, even vegetarians and children!  Try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat.  Try the chicken or paneer Makhani if you don't like the heat!  For medium-spicy dishes, the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread!  If you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor, try the Tandoor Fish wrap!  The key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more, get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table.  You don't have to drink alcohol, but there's a full service bar at all 3 of the Tandoori Times locations and the beer selection is above-average!  This is the newest of the 3 locations and features a large inside area with an AMAZING patio (complete with firepit and hookah)!  Bellydancers join the fun on Friday and Saturday nights.  Decent value if you crave very good quality food, an exotic atmosphere and an authentic Indian experience.  Ok, the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic, but it's definitely exciting!  One of my favorite weekend hangouts...solid 5 out of 5!|review|q2voHQRY7Mcuv_fIPD8cug|0|0|0
gbLPR7iykaZaHtE2spUxwA|2013-07-01|nAMKGOpXTdFBcyla7MhKBg|2|***I have tried a few Dunkin' Donuts locations and it is not my favorite donut spot (the donuts here are similar to what I have had at other Dunkin' Donuts); I tried this Dunkin' Donuts' breakfast sandwich and it was below average--even for a fast food breakfast sandwich***  Dunkin' Donuts has a real following.  I think a lot of it has to due with their popular coffee, but I think their donuts are popular too.  I grew up in the Midwest and I remember Dunkin' Donuts were around, but I think most of the donut shops near me were local options.  I believe Tim Hortons and Krispy Kreme were also around.  I am not aware of any Dunkin' Donuts properties in Los Angeles.  I think they go as west as Las Vegas and Arizona.  I see a Krispy Kreme every now and again in California.  This Dunkin' Donuts in Arizona reminds me of the ones that I have been to.  It has a decent selection of donuts and donut holes (called Munchkins here).  Dunkin' Donuts has glazed donuts, but I do not think glazed is their signature item like Krispy Kreme.  Instead, I think it is more about their chocolate and filled donuts--especially their Boston Kreme.  I had their blueberry donut, which was a blueberry cake donut with a hardened glazed crust.  The blueberry cake was just not that great.  It was a little dry and it lacked a good blueberry flavor.  In addition to their donuts, this Dunkin' Donuts also carries several breakfast pastries including bagels, muffins and danishes.  This store also carries a selection of breakfast sandwiches.  I had their ham, egg and cheese, which came on an English muffin.  The ham was not that good.  I prefer the warmer (as well as better flavor of) the Canadian bacon at McDonald's.  The egg was also not that good.  It looked like the hard cooked egg at McDonald's though Dunkin' Donuts' preparation lacked both McDonald's egg's thickness and flavor.  Prices were okay.  Ordering a few items is a little pricey though I think if you order a dozen or so donuts, prices are about what you would expect to pay at a donut shop.  Service was okay.  The staff was polite enough but not particularly friendly or pleasant.  They were out of a few things because they may not have prepared them appropriately in the morning.  There are a few tables in this Dunkin' Donuts property if you want to eat in.  I have been to a few Dunkin' Donuts locations and they just do not seem to measure up to Krispy Kreme and this location is no different.  Krispy Kreme's donuts are tastier and seem a lot fresher.  I think Dunkin' Donuts is only worth a try if you have never been and are curious to see what the fuss is about.  This Dunkin' Donuts is located in a shopping plaza that has its own huge and free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.|review|xNb8pFe99ENj8BeMsCBPcQ|9|7|11

Consistently great food & drinks. Service has more spunk and personality at this Postino location too. Try the cucumber lemonade if you don't like wine or just plain water.

So, we turned around and headed back to Scottsdale to get some food. I remembered this place on my ""to eat"" list from YELP. We found it on the blackberry and off we went.   It was not very crowded. We were seated right away. Our seater and server were very nice. The server made recommendations, one being the soup choice. It was not a super hot day, so we were opting for soup and he said the presentation of this one particular soup was very good... flames. I believe it was chicken wonton soup.  We also ordered the drunken dragon noodles and a vegetable dish (that I just cannot remember right now.)    The waiter was correct, the presentation of the soup was great. I even took pictures, as hard as it is to get flames on film. The plates were all average sized, but plenty for the two of us. The food was all quite good, though a bit on the pricier side for thai.   Overall, I think an excellent selection for the evening.

But all of the food is homemade and above average for a typical strip mall Mexican place. I'm a regular and have figured out what I like, but if you are new to it, you might not stumble on your faves immediately.  I, for one, love the shredded beef and both kinds of pork, which are marinated to the point of being saturated with flavor, in a good way. Beans and rice are average. I don't care much for the enchilada sauce, but I love the corn tortillas, so I'm good with the tacos.  Today I tried the sopes, which I haven't had in a long time, and they were wonderful. It's like a tostada, but with a thick cornmeal crust instead of the usual crispy fried tortilla.  Now, this is not ""go-out-of-your-way, travel-across-town, God-it's-awesome, Guy-Fieri-is-a-genius"" wonderful.

An hour of my life I'll never get back and $40 for two bowls and two juices of all which got thrown away. GG is a JOKE on anything healthy or nutritionally orientated. It's really too bad that people are so desperate for ""healthy"" food or no longer have taste buds from eating so unhealthy that they really think these boxes of crap are good. You know, my bad though. After seeing how filthy it was, no greeting upon entering, being handed off to the sweaty guy who couldn't even look us in the eye to take our order, because I think he was too busy worried about the sweat about to roll down his face, GROSS! I should have walked out. The only thing they have going is location, I think. I live in Cenpho and generally can't stand anything in NS, because as I have found out it always like this. Pseudo trendy, subpar food and crap service to wannabe's. Oh, they hit the nail on the head. Here's my suggestion for anyone wanting to try this place, Grab onto your Greens, shove them as far in your wallet or pocket  as possible and save your hard earned money for truly great healthy food. Take a drive to the SE part of the city and see how Pomegranate Café gets it right."|review|Ntxl5G4Cr1Fo-y8e84YUug|0|0|2

They taste fresh (because they are), and you can have them however you want.  They have numerous specialty burgers too.  The fries are ordinary.  But they have a shaker bottle of seasoning on the table that really helps them.  They are hot and fresh, but not seasoned.  Their shakes are pretty good, and they give you a lot (the glass, plus any extra in the metal mixing cup).  This is one of my preferred burger places (when I go out for a burger, which isn't really that often).|review|Mb0psF4WQF7gZSuZafVr-g|0|0|0

We decided to bring the dog with us so he could experience Lola too. :)  We sat outside and apprehensively parked the dog outside, making sure to clear it with the staff that it was okay to have him outside. The petite brunette barista (wish I had gotten her name!) was so incredibly sweet and gracious. She took the time to come outside and greet our dog, even bringing him a ""puppyccino,"" just water in a bowl but a very sweet gesture nonetheless.  The inside is clean and modern looking, but not so modern that all the furniture is uncomfortable. I could certainly see myself passing away lazy weekend days here, happily caffeinated and making good use of the wi-fi. I really wish I had come here sooner, I feel they certainly deserve the business with their tasty and reasonably priced coffee, great staff and low-key ambiance."|review|DJzbBORAJjTiTzFCEdoMQQ|1|1|1

My stuff actually gets fixed and tends to stay that way.  But I'm still counting down the 5 months I have left on my lease.  My upstairs neighbors have been a nightmare to deal with the past 6 months. Unfortunately complaining and calling the cops on more than one occasion doesn't seem to matter. Nothing seems to happen to them. Despite the insane noise level up to 1-3am, the fighting & causing damage to property(which affects me when glass from their broken window is all over my doorway area.  The horribly strong smell of them smoking pot and having their door open and letting it all outside so myself and my little girls have to smell it a few times a week just walking by.  My overall feeling is, I feel better dealing with the new staff. They have always been nice/helpful regardless of who i've gone to. They'd get 4 stars from me.  But the fact that my obnoxious neighbors don't even seem to get any kind of warnings make me hate coming home everyday.  So my living experience gets 2 stars.|review|YhoyllHIHf34TMC5M7VJIw|0|0|0

fZBCZu_g5XuqnOnOU_Z20A|2013-08-16|m9aNSQVlE1ma_hHBKzHgew|2|Physicians assigned to this clinic are generally medical students that haven't graduated yet. So their medical knowledge and experience is very limited. In my particular case, my MD completed his medical schooling in the Carribean. I saw a 2nd physician one day when my regular physician could not see me. She was even worse and was clearly not educated or prepared to discuss what needed to be discussed from a medical standpoint.   I was receiveing injections that I could have done at home myself, but my physician would not authorize this. So this ended up costing me about $50 a month what with the medicine and the nursing visit (and this was after insurance). Plus I had to go into the clinic every month, taking time off from work.   After going to the clinic for nearly a year, I called one day to schedule an appointment to see my physician and was told he had graduated and was no longer at this clinic. My doctor never even bothered to tell me he was leaving nor transition my case to another doctor at the clinic. Very unprofessional.   On one visit, they just left me waiting in the lobby for nearly an hour before they called me back to see the nurse. However, during this time I saw many people go in and out and some that were there after me. I also noticed some of the nursing staff huddled together joking and laughing it up, while patients waited outside to be seen.   And don't even get me started on the goons that they refer to as security at this place. I was verbally assaulted by one of them when I went in one day for my monthly visit. And have been made to feel uncomfortable by other guards on other occassions.   After a year, I just had enough and will find a new clinic.|review|j472C2lnLtcdyXz4qA0YrA|0|0|0

I picked up a menu to study prior to ordering. We ended up splitting the seafood hot pot, lamb pastrami and Peking duck steamed buns, smoked ""pig face"" dumplings and Chinese long beans. While the hot pot was good, I probably wouldn't order it again (but I'm not a huge soup person, unless it's pho). The house bacon lured me to order the Peking duck, and while it was delicious on its own it wasn't as amazing as the lamb pastrami. Good gravy that meat rocked! The pig face dumplings are packed with guanciale and is absolutely heavenly paired with kimchi. The long beans with crispy duck tongue were as awesome as it sounds--the lightly battered and fried tongues taste slightly like mushrooms and melt in your mouth.  Overall, we were both impressed with Cleaver Koi. The food was great and reasonably priced. The music was hip but not too loud. While there is outside seating, it's far too cold to enjoy. Regardless, I'm already planning my next meal for when I return."|review|nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw|1|0|2

And while we would l-o-v-e to take advantage of that fact and enjoy ourselves a leisurely brunch/coffee every now and then...we won't. Probably ever. Why? Because Luci's, while a wonderful concept (LGO much?), fails miserably at being what they claim to be.  Um, the food? Awful. The menu sure sounds appetizing, but what you pay big bucks for is appalling. We had breakfast a few weeks ago and our dishes (a breakfast bagel sandwich and french toast) were cold, flavorless, and just plain ugly (am I allowed to use that word when describing food?).   First, we paid $20 for two breakfast plates and an iced coffee.   Second, after ringing our orders incorrectly and overcharging us, they forgot the sandwich order and were out of iced coffee. This wasn't an all at once kind of blow either, more like every five minutes we noticed or someone informed us of a mistake. Enjoying breakfast is difficult with constant let down being thrown in.   Third, everything was served on crappy styrofoam plates. With plastic utensils. See Reason #1 for explanation why this is not okay.  Should I even keep going?   Fourth, the ""door"" was open and we were swarmed by flies the entire time (DISGUSTING). Dozens of flies were crawling on everything and we spent majority of our meal swatting them away. None of the staff seemed concerned.  And lastly, I said it once but I'm saying it again: the food. Terrible. My french toast sounded utterly delectable on paper but was delivered cold, totally flavorless (how can you make cinnamon bread dipped in batter flavorless?) and cost a ridiculous $10. No sides, no pretty garnish to soften the blow of how unappealing it was... just a sad stack of three slices of the worst toast I've ever tasted.   NOW, if Luci's stepped up with a complete redo, maybe we'd try them again. For now though, we're sticking with LGO...even if it's a 10 minute drive."|review|4dnDsoHuxUtzhaumxbpR5w|0|0|2

Must be the slowest day of the year for restaurant businesses.  Many restos were closed and this was the first place on my ""to try list"" that I found open after calling several other places.  I wish I had stayed away, perhaps had McDonalds?  Perhaps kept calling down my list?   I was seated on the bar side.  The bar side has around a 12 top bar and about 6 or so tables.  I saw 4 different guys/servers/bartenders taking food/drink orders and delivering food and drinks.  I could sense there was chaos in their service, so when they came to take my drink order, I stopped the guy from quickly leaving my table and ordered my food.  Food came out... great.  I'm eating.  Now, I want my beer.  BUT, I must have been invisible after my food was delivered.  None of them came back to my table.  I wanted to try one of the craft beers.  I saw other people being serviced at the bar and their tables and  trying and ordering them.  I just kept waiting and thinking, some1 will come to my table next.  Hum, no.  So, I gave up on ordering the beer, since I had finished my brat.  I waited and waited and attempted to signal for my check.  Nada. Zilch.  I had to finally yell out for my check.  ""Ahhhh, can I get my check, today?""    Needless to say, I know where I'm unappreciated.  My dollars can go some place else.  I hate I had to spend my money there.  If I could have un-eaten the food, I would have so I could keep my money in my pocket!  As for the food, it was just ok.

WxpCYziMlEy8mrEa_VcB1w|2012-07-30|K8B4fTwmeBxgqz-nIgKfLA|3|Ok, so I didn't try the tortilla soup.  my bad.  I guess I should have.  Maybe I'd have been more impressed.  I'm not overly thrilled with this place, but I was not underwhelmed either.  The ambiance is terrible - kinda like Mexico City meets school cafeteria.  Service was adequate, and the prices are reasonable.  I reviewed their website before going to make sure I knew where the place was, and I have to say whomever designed their website should give them a refund.  Yes, it's flashy and cool, but navigation is a PITA and trying to read the menu in such a small window is difficult, knowing that there are multiple pages helps though - even though they are hard to find.  When people can't find you, or have difficulty navigating your website to get information, they quickly lose interest.  just sayin.  I came with the family, celebrating a visit from my oldest daughter, and since we've always wanted to try LPS, this was the opportunity.  the flourescent lights glaring down from the high ceiling really light up the place, like border patrol checkpoint bright.  It made it real easy to see the food, and everybody elses food too - as in everybody else in the place.  I dunno, it's not like I want it dark, but you could soften the lighting just a bit. I ordered the Bistek con Enchilada Suiza - with green sauce.  It wasn't bad.  The freshly made corn tortillas just fell apart and were worthless as taco devices.  I ended up just eating my tacos with a fork and spoon.  The enchiladas were ok, not too spicy and had a bit of flavor - the green sauce option really helped.  It was sort of a spicy tomatillo sauce.  I don't eat rice, but it appeared to be the standard orangish mexican rice.  The beans were served in a little bowl and were not refried, which was a refreshing change of pace, and the complimentary chips and salsa were good.  Overall, the food was not bad, I guess I was expecting something more, like spice, but I understand that central mexico cuisine is not necessarily spicy.  I would have settled for more flavor.  Others in my party had similar comments about their dishes, nobody was really jazzed after that meal.|review|J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ|2|3|2

Don't fret because JoBot's lights are still on late into the night. While I can't say exactly just how late ""late"" is because I haven't payed too close attention to that minor detail and no one has posted it here on yelp yet. I can say they've been open every time I have visited after 11pm.  Mental note to self, next time at JoBot find out about hours and update yelp. Is it considered a mental note if I just wrote it down? I'm also not so sure it was to self either as I plan to post this review sometime soon.   Anyway.  Give any of their crepes a try, they're all fairly good; although, I do prefer the savory crepes over the sweet crepes here. I truly can't believe I just said that actually, since most of my other reviews are for frozen yogurt and cupcakes, at least that's what I tried to order and was told ""We don't actually serve frozen yogurt here sir. Would you like to try our crepes?""  Loved the chorizo and egg crepe - twas the perfect combination of everything they combined together to make the crepe. I'm pretty sure it was part chorizo, part egg, part cheese and part crepe. But then again it was a late night and I did just swing by after visiting Lost Leaf next door.  I hear they serve excellent coffee too, but I tend to stick to tea and pastries. Happy wandering my yelping friends!

You could get a mesquite grilled half chicken(w/guac, ranchero beans, salsa, cucumbers and lettuce on the side) for $6.24. its enough chicken to feed two people. they also have 1/4 chicken, and whole chicken for more people. my favorite meat here is the Al Pastor(marinated pork). its probably the most authentic flavor of Al Pastor that comes closest to tacos in mexico.   with tacos and combo meals you get the choice of corn or flour tortillas. Take it from me and trust me on this, get the flour tortillas. their corn tortillas seem to be the buy at the grocery store type. nothing special.

I am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 just because of the ridiculousness that was my sandwich. I asked for no cheese, add avocado. Simple right? Apparently not because about 80 percent of the time I have asked for avocado (and it costs an extra 75 cents mind you) I haven't received it. You think I would just learn and stop asking for it, but I tried again. This time they gave me cheese and no avocado. Apparently this is the hardest thing this place has to do because they can NEVER get it right. And this time they actually added something I specifically said not to. So eff you Spicy Pickle. I am breaking up with you.   5/1/11  ----------------------------------------------------------  Working in an office is sort of like searching through yelp. Your coworkers bring in lunch from random lunch places you didn't know existed, and then you file them away in your bookmark section of your brain to try later and review. Spicy Pickle is one of those places I had no idea existed. I moved to this area of town almost two years ago and I am still finding new places to try. Its like a food expedition every time I go out. I had seen one of my coworkers bring in Spicy Pickle about four times before I decided to try it late last year. I have been here at least seven or eight times by now, but lately I just have not been that impressed.  When I first came to spicy pickle I was excited about another sandwich place to try. You see, I love sandwiches. You give me two pieces of bread with any combination of dressings, mayos, and veggies in between them and I am one happy girl. I don't know if the excitement got to me or what but for at least a month after I found this place I was in here every week at least. Its right down the street from my work as well so that made it super convenient. I have only had the Bastille sandwich, but of course I customize it to my tastes. I skip the cheese, sub sun dried tomato mayo for basil mayo, and add avocado. It was pretty tasty. But then I don't know what happened. Maybe I ate it so much I got sick of it, or maybe I just realized it was only a sub par sandwich, but I fell out of love with Spicy Pickle. Every time my husband wants to come here now I make a face. Maybe its because they added on a side with every sandwich as well as raising their prices. I'd rather have no side and less expensive sandwiches, thanks.   BUT! There is one thing I continue to love about Spicy Pickle, and you guessed it. Its the pickles. They are so spicy and crunchy and I love that. I have a hard time finding a spicy pickle at the store that I like. Maybe I need to learn to make my own. But anyways. It has been a few months now since I have been here and I haven't had a craving to return. Perhaps one day I will. But for now I will continue to think about their pickles and wish I could just buy them by the jarful.|review|2nXFEyQ06RfcdAXIPbxuwA|1|2|1

BZ5Fqx0dTwZgnLzCcMyJaQ|2009-08-05|Mhq9uRq5NQtHrJk0JxZTNw|5|"I went here for a sandwich  (the #20 with Ham, Bologna, Genoa Salami, Capocolla, Cooked Salami, American & Provolone Cheese) and thought it was absolutely delicious.  The sandwich meat was extremely tasty, although the bread was admittedly about average.    It seemed like everyone in the place knew one another, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective (I was eating alone so felt slightly out of place, although the man and woman running the place were both very courteous and friendly).  However, I do think that if you want to feel like you are eating a homemade sandwich in a friend's kitchen, this would be a good place to go.     Another yelper suggested that this is ""pricey,"" which I think is strange.  A full size sandwich or a half sandwich/soup costs 5 dollars -- that strikes me as a fairly inexpensive lunch.  The menu is online, so you can decide yourself if eating here is going to bust your budget."|review|yIYQewxT56mvIDLuBm7k9Q|0|0|0

I also love the ease of the drive through and that I can place an order on my way home from work and not have to get out of my car.  That being said, the rest of the menu is way overpriced for the quality. The Italian Beef sandwich was pretty weak. It tasted like a frozen beef  that was reheated with a ridiculous amount of mozzarella cheese on it. I expected better. The same can be said of the meatball sandwich.

The handcrafted beers that I have tried are all very good. My personal favorite is the Kilt Lifter, an amber ale, similar to a Fat Tire but not nearly as sweet.    This Friday I met some colleagues at the 4 Peaks in North Scottsdale. A friend and I decided to split the 16"" barbecue chicken pizza. This size was just right for 2 people. We both started out very hungry and still had two slices left over.  I would rate the quality of the pizza below dedicated pizza joints like Bianco, Grimaldi's and Humble Pie, but above places like Peter Piper, Zipps, etc... It was about on par with something you would get from Papa Johns or Dominos, which is just fine in my book if accompanied by a really good cold beer.   The place was full and had a lively atmosphere. The only thing missing was a good college football game. With that in mind, next time I will go on a Saturday. Cheers!"|review|omGocLsyIYeiHPviDOAa3w|0|1|1

It's hard to describe why its so satisfying digging through beat up Marc Jacobs and Chloe bags looking for one that's worth buying, but it is!! There are some items you need to bring when you come here though:  -hand sanitizer, you will smell like a dirty shoe afterwards  -your b*tch face, you might need this when someone won't move out of your way in the shoe aisle - stink eye, you need this for the same reason as above.   Why would someone go here you may ask? Because if you find something worth buying the discounts are amazing and you have a cool story to tell someone when they ask where you got your bag.

The food here is typical, bland, and uninspired, which is sometimes good when you just don't want any surprises.  Don't expect to get anything too pungent or too spicy here.  Because the food is kept in warming trays, it usually has a ""dried out"" taste to it if you don't get it fresh during the lunch rush (and even then, it's not a given).

In addition, to this day, my buddy and I constantly rate this as our favorite LSU road game of all time, and we've been to almost all of the stadiums in the SEC and i've been to few Pac 10 stadiums when I lived in Cali.  The game I attended was LSU vs Arizona St game in 2005.  The game was originally supposed to be played in Tiger Stadium but was moved to Sun Devil Stadium the Monday before the game because LSU's basketball stadium, across the street from Tiger Stadium, was being used as a makeshift hospital in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Officially the logistics of holding such a big event are not easily planned.  You have police needing to coordinate game day traffic, stadium security, concessions, volunteers to work the stadium, etc.  Given the time to get ready, 4 days, I think the staff at Sun Devil Stadium/Arizona State did an incredible job of hosting this game.  Not only that, they had volunteers collecting money for Hurricane relief.    Another plus feature of Sun Devil Stadium.  They painted the endzones to dedicate the state of Louisiana, they played LSU's pregame video, and they flew out The Golden Band from Tigerland.  To top it all off, Arizona St, donated the proceeds of the game for Hurricane Relief specifically towards student relief.   The game ended up being decided late in the 4th qtr, a FG block return for a TD, a punt block return for a TD, and a 60+ yd bomb from JaMarcus Russell (bless his NFL career) on a 4th and 12 were the differences in the game.  Best part of the trip though, Friday night in Tempe.  Friendly and HOTTTTTTTT coeds of Arizona State.  A lot of people think UGA girls are hot, but damnnnnnnnn Arizona State girls are tops in the US.  (I would have loved to attend the 2008 UGA vs ASU game in Tempe).  That Friday night was easily Top 10 nights ever for my life.  We were sad to find out that LSU/ASU postponed the series, and the fact LSU isn't scheduled to play in Tempe until the 2016 season, which would put me at 35 years of age.

And I always like an excuse to linger in downtown Phoenix and people-watch after the sun goes down and the trees in the AZ Center light up. Secondly, I've become somewhat addicted to their wings ever since being invited here a couple of times on somebody else's dollar. They're really perfectly seasoned with just enough peppery heat. Mind you, this is not my favorite place in Phoenix for hot wings when I am on that mission, but these are a very compelling appetizer.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover they offer a 10%-off discount if you check in through Yelp on your mobile phone. They already had me at Happy Hour drink and appetizer discounts, but another break on the price is always welcome.  Consider checking out 1130 if you're catching a movie at the cinemas in the Arizona Center. You could always go for a plate of wings instead of a movie theater hot dog, couldn't you?

This was my first experience in a Tapas Restaurant but boy was I extremely impressed.  The atmosphere was absolutely brilliant, and I even felt that I was dining in a different country.   We walked in without reservations but were treated like we were regulars by the general manager.  We sat at the bar and ordered drinks while we waited.  I am normally a vodka drinker, but the bartender told us we had to try their Sangria.  I can tell you this: It was so worth going out of my comfort level, and I realized that maybe I should listen to the experts more often.    Our wait time was only half the time we were supposed to wait.  We sat down and were entertained with the Flamenco dancers.  When the food got to the table it was out of this world.  We tried things that I never thought to eat in my entire life along with other delicacies.  The owner Joseph came over to introduce himself and it felt like he actually cared that we were dining in his restaurant.  In today's dining very rarely do you ever have the owner conversing with the patrons and making them feel at home.  Best of all, he sent complimentary champagne over because we were dining for a special event.

The taste of pho (beef noodle soup) is authentic and delicious. We also ordered the BBQ pork w/ vermicelli noodles with chili sauce on the side. The restaurant is a cafe-style atmosphere, clean, and very pleasant to eat in. The Price is about $7-8 per item; it is a bit more expensive than in San Francisco due to less competition. We also love their home made dessert for $3.50 and will definitely revisit soon.|review|1cKTUGVPmRJRrihjdxbPlA|0|0|3

Long time customers could probably agree that the customer service in most places is like a casino game, you get lucky every once in a while but most of the time it's a shot in the dark. Also the prices have gone up while the quality and quantity goes down. And for someone like me who had a ""usual"" it was very surprising to see the kinds of changes being made over the years.   Also...don't go past 7pm, you'll get left with the slim pickings. I had a Ceasar salad so soggy and the croutons were not fresh, you could squish them with the fork. Thankfully when we showed the manager she didn't charge me for it. The evening staff is also a younger, not very experienced group. We were sitting in the booths next to the kitchen and we could here them joking and cussing with eachother. They also left some guy waiting with a to go order over 5min just to fetch change they clearly forgot. So there was more than one person who left disappointed.  I used to really like this place, but I definitely think tonight Is the last time my family and I will be returning.

Warm, delicious bread was immediately served.  Started with Mussels, Pear and Gorgonzola salad and pate. The Mussels and Salad were excellent. The pate was a little disappointing. Chewy and not very tasty. It was country style.    Our entrees were all excellent. Salmon, Short ribs and steak.  The Salmon had this awesome crispy skin, delicious blue cheese potatoes. Steak was excellent. Short ribs had a cumin citrus sauce that was so good. The meat was falling off the bones. It was served over risotto that was a tad salty but very good.  We got three desserts. The warm chocolate cake was a little standard but the raspberry mint sorbet was a true winner and I don't even love sorbet.  Creme brulee cheesecake was heavenly.  Service was great. We highly recommend sitting out on the patio. It's like a little oasis.|review|5F3d1LLjaYrPTBb-cygIPw|0|0|0

She has a thing for sashimi so I figured this place was pretty good...well reviewed and semi-upscale.   The place is small...we had to wait standing in line for about an hour and a half. I wish it was shorter or we could've made a reservation but with the way women get ready...I didn't know if I was going to arrive within 10 minutes of my reservation or 10 days (let's be honest here). I then asked and I think I recollect that they don't take reservations.  The parking is somewhat tight when it's night time. Apparently, this is where they get the most business. However, I guess you can always park in the neighborhood streets just a few feet away.   It's BYOB. You can bring your own alcohol. I wish I would've brought Moscato but we didn't know until I asked.   Our waitress service was slow, but we sat up front and the Sushi Master was a old Japanese guy...quite nice guy. He attended to us very well.   Their prices are a little higher than what I'm accustomed to from eating at places like Saki Bomber's or Kabuki but I like watching the food being made in front of me.  I would say the food is very fresh but let's face it...the coast is in California and we all know about the drive from there. However, the food was still very delicious. We also bought some of the soup noodle to go. That was very delicious still when we got hungry later on.  They had this very cool menu item I think where they bring you a wooden boat with fire and sushi on it. I came back a few days later with a friend and ordered it. Very good.  Overall, I thought this place was a very nice date night place. The wait sucks but  it's worth it. We came out full and with a few takeout boxes.|review|4P9VlxUcoDIv_HQH05MzpA|1|0|0

However, it was superior to Sauce and Olive & Ivy... and probably as enjoyable as Modern Steak.  My mother was in town this weekend, and we decided to do some shopping at Biltmore Fashion Park.  We needed to fuel our engines, and wanted to try something different than Cheesecake Factory.  We liked the breezy openness of Zinburger, which is what drew us in.    Our server was young, a little hyper, and was completely unprepared to answer our questions regarding the menu or to offer us any recommendations.  We were left to our own devices, though he was prompt.  We had our food quickly... though the fact that we dined in between lunch and dinner probably had more to do with it than the quality of his service.  The portions are quite large, and we were both full after splitting the sliders (which are not on the menu, and were a daily special) and an order of zucchini fries.  We were both very impressed with the quality of the zucchini fries, which were delicious.  The sliders were alright - the meat was tasty, but the bread and lettuce left something to be desired.    Our parking chip was validated for two hours, which spared us from paying for our very excellent parking spot.  Considering we did not purchase dessert and shared our meal, our tab was very reasonable, and we both left full.  The decor was bright and brazen... and we both thought it was pretty reminiscent of Chick-fil-A.    We both left pretty happy, and it wasn't a bad experience... but yet again, I don't know that it was so memorable that I'd be telling my friends about it or taking my close friends there to dine.|review|uVO-X-GyoZsw7BmVmG7Jyw|1|0|1

If there were a Mexican Food Anonymous, I'd absolutely need to join.  Like a few of the previous Yelpers, I ordered the #8 combination, which was a chile relleno, beef taco, and enchilada with rice and beans. -The beef taco was crisp, yes, but there was the tiniest little shred of beef in it. Might as well have been a fried shell. I took one bite that had meat. The rest was empty. -The chile relleno was extremely greasy. I don't know if their oil was not hot enough to fry or what, but the batter on the outside of the rellano seemed to be more of an oil sponge than anything. Took one bite and pushed the rest aside. -The enchilada, generally my least favorite of mexican fare, was actually pretty good. Really plain, but the sauce was the lifesaver on this one. I actually ate the whole enchilada. -Beans were runny and flavorless. No thanks -Rice was fluffy, but much like it's frijole counterpart, had no flavor. No thanks again.  All this for 10 bucks (granted that's not a lot of money... but it kind of is considering all I got out of it was basically a bite of taco and a cheese enchilada).  At least the people who worked there were nice.  I won't be back. Sorry.|review|sMIOqXFpm6XuBlaokNdpAA|0|0|2

I haven't had a single bad meal here. In fact, everything I have tried here has been great. Not only does everything taste amazing, I feel great after eating it.  My favorites here so far are the chicken protein bowl with quinoa, the tri-tip sandwich and the chicken and prosciutto sandwich. I was a bit worried about the sandwiches because of the whole wheat low-carb bread, but these did not have that cardboard taste that I have come to associate with low-carb. The bread seemed like a cross between a pita and wheat bread. They were nice and soft and the flavor was really good.  I have yet to try the salads or the breakfast, but I will get there. I have no doubt that they will be just as good as everything else so far.|review|onBbAyffJ_DA1M_UQXXxRw|0|0|0

We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he ""only gets a complaint once every 2 months"" and that he has a ""packed house."" He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said ""whatever"" and left, shortly returning with our refund. Food: -Clam and fettuccine-far too salty -Tomato sauce- tastes like canned -Gnocchi-mushy, no texture -Bolognese-no flavor  Bottom line: -Rude, arrogant owner -Bland,over-priced food -Never returning!!  I really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good.

We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of their patio, complete with a little fountain, on a beautiful sunny day, and the yummy food and lovely service added up to a great experience. At first glance this place strikes me as a bit corporate, but at the end of it I felt that they really provided a unique experience.   Two highlights of the meal: the delicious pesto that comes out with their free foccacia bread, which must have a wheel of parmesan in each bowl, because it's so rich and wonderful. I also adored the asparagus, mushroom and white truffle oil flatbread, which I shared with the table and immediately wished I had gotten just for myself.   I also had the chopped chicken salad, which I found to be disappointing. First of all, there was WAY too much dressing on it, so everything felt drenched and a little wilted. Also, I was initially really curious about the granola that comes in it but I actually didn't feel that it added very much to the flavor and found myself picking around it.   I'd definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants some pretty classic salads, sandwiches and flatbreads with a little fancied-up twist!|review|Prsk7SiPZNfgcPyygOdGHg|12|6|11

They also have children's clothing, toys and games, and a book store. We went over the 4th of July weekend and most stores were having massive sales, with some exceptional sales such as Banana Republic with their 50% off the entire store sale.  The way to get here is a bit roundabout, as you will have to drive away from the mall before you start to head towards it again. Although there seems to be a lot of parking spaces, there's just one small section that has covered canopy parking.   Options for food are a bit limited. So far, there's Chinese, Italian, salads/sandwiches, and Subway. Across from the food court there's also a pretzel shop. There will be a Charley's grilled cheesesteaks/subs that will open up soon, as well as a Dairy Queen (The DQ will be outside of the food court though).

I asked the waitress which of the fries were better and she suggested that I just mix them which I did.  The regular fries were good, but man oh man...the sweet potato fries were fantastic!  We started with some spicy edamame...take my advice and order some of it next time! You won't be sorry!  As far as cocktails go, I am not a fan of super sweet drinks so I asked our server what she suggested.  I went with her suggestion and ordered the Blood Orange Martini and ended up have 2 of them.    All in all, Hula's made my birthday celebration very special and everyone enjoyed their time there!  We'll definitely be going back!!!|review|hs8t_DMnNNpf_wXtFE2xpw|1|0|1

It was dead in the place being ASU was on break.  Food menu is pretty limited but the prices were fair. Was disappointed in the milk shake as it was rather plain. Had the guacomole burger and it was ok also. I'm knocking it down from 4 stars to 3 because the place was dirty.  All the tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down all day, and like I said the place was empty so no excuse for having a dirty restaurant.|review|b2DKC4kC8-QeSeGZ_MF3XQ|0|0|0
MhkZLdUFaHt5SDcQcqOWQg|2011-10-03|X_O3C-YwFKuAdGFhRx6Gkg|4|Second visit to Fresh Wasabi...   Arizona Rolls, fabulous... As I previously stated, we are not sushi fans, I must amend, we were not sushi fans, we are beginning to be now... And the Arizona Roll is what brought us around!  Very fresh, firm but not sticky rice that was also very light.  The Wasabi was full of flavor but not too hot.  We do wish they had given us a little more though...  Calamari... It was ok, it was chewy, rubbery, over cooked.  The batter was really good and the sauce was tasty and this was the saving grace. Once the calamari cooled though, it was just gross...  Udon noodles, again, very hot, Momma said too hot and based on my prior experience with them, I have to agree.  The broth was fabulous, again, and the yummies in the dish were just that, yummy!  I still think it needed more meat, but it is a noodle dish...  Spicy chicken dinner combo... Wish the chicken pieces were bigger but the spices and sauce were phenomenal!!!!!!  Portion was really good and plentiful without being too much...  As with last time, for some reason I have a hard time pin-pointing, the service was lacking.  We got drink refills and it was reasonably attentive, but something was missing... At least this time there was no dissertation on bento boxes and sushi... Wish I could figure out what it was... Just off somehow...   Overall, they earned a star over last visit and we will be back, no doubt!|review|nTCt6CV-qx3lHsHIMJqizg|0|0|0

Our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable about the menu and had excellent recommendations, the outdoor courtyard table right in front of the fireplace was as romantic as it gets, and the entire atmosphere was dreamy.  The food did not disappoint neither.  We had the pork belly to start with- cooked perfectly tender with avocado mousse and spicy mustard on the side- the boyfriend even said it was better than his entrée!    I had the pork shoulder as main and the boyfriend had the flank steak.  The pork shoulder was charred and crispy on the edge and tender on the inside, every bite was heaven, paired with a very good Merlot.  The flank steak was very good, according to the boyfriend, as well.  We were too full to get dessert but I heard good things about the chocolate churro.  Although pricy, but definitely worth a visit.|review|T4V80_qBPa9kFnzGQmVYXg|1|1|1

But after about 3 months, their repair to my Mustang is holding up very well.  They took steps to further brace and secure a new aftermarket bumper and paint matches perfectly.    Suspension and other non-body work had to subbed out, so there was quite a bit of delay and phone tagging.  Emails were hit or miss too.  In the end, I also had to remind about their ""pay your rental car"" coverage they advertised.  A longer process than we thought needed, but it ultimately worked out well.  Luis and Mike were very easygoing and truly made sure we were happy as reasonable through the process.  Every detail about their in-house paint/repair was gone over thoroughly so that the detail was clearly understood.  There were no surprises, except that their work was better than a few W Valley shops I've worked with.  Spot on in-house work."|review|Lwds1ifJH-dVKU2C2IJIHg|0|0|0

The patio was crowded and the place was way understaffed.  It took forever to get our drink order in.  The beer came out room temp.  The garlic fries came out next and were cold.  We waited around for the server to return with condiments but he never did.  I had to get up and find him to let him know the fries were cold and we needed condiments.  He brought out condiments and a new order of hot fries.  The new fries were much better.  My date had one bite of her salad and found a large piece of wet paper towel in her salad.  I immediately showed the waiter and he took it away and asked if she wanted another salad.  A food runner came back with a new salad and apologized for the paper towel and told us the salad was organic and came wrapped in towels and he didn't knew how it got in there.  Since they had cleared my food by then and took her salad, she had no silverware.  We waited 5 minutes before a server was in site to ask for more silverware.  The check took forever to come and when our waiter brought it, he told us he comped the salad.  Overall, 7 strikes against Brat Haus for the horrible service and aweful food tonight.  I wish it had been better since I used to love this spot.  Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning.|review|qmZ-3X6w_mI5fEoVvi-cfg|0|0|0

A differential is the nest of gears spinning a vehicle's axles, allowing the wheels to turn at different speeds without destroying something mechanical.  For example, turning a corner, or one wheel on the road, the other in mud.  Or, front wheels on rock, rear wheels in slush.  Or spin them equally fast for drag racing.      The axles and nest of gears driving them require many bearings.  Gears and bearings require lubrication.  Oil is a simple word for lubrication.  Gaskets are soft seals keeping lubrication in the right places.  Gears and bearings wear out over time.  Lifetimes for gears and bearings can be short or long, depending how hard they're used and how well they are lubricated.    Two auto shops I'll not name here, failed to identify the train-like rumbling in the car's drive train.   Sam at Affordable Auto said, ""Take it to AZ Differential Specialists.""  After looking over the mechanical situation, a failing bearing and carrier,  Bubba provided a reasonable quote.  I requested they replace all bearings and the slightly damaged axle found during inspection.  That added $250 in parts and labor.  The axle and diff will run another 60K or so miles."|review|Ry48Bta6spNowOkiMNC_xg|0|0|2

Imagine my surprise when all I saw was hotdogs on the menu! Took me a minute to figure out why, but once I did, since I was there, I thought I'd try something. Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect. Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that, has mustard too, perfect way to eat a hot dog. Shakes were on sale, so i got a chocolate one. The shake was ok, it didn't make it back to the office, but not because it was 'awesome', it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had. Got to the office, opened the bag, pulled out the hotdog and, well, was quite disappointed. The photo shows a HOTDOG in a bun with a nice stripe of mustard and a heaping amount of sauerkraut. That is not what I got. I got a hotdog in a BUN, with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard. Ok, so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs, where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side, so i was expecting as such. That's how the photo looked, but no, no dog sticking out. took me two bites each end to find the hot dog. and it was no bigger around than my finger and was tasteless. Won't go there again.|review|uVQsFZV4EDXmnef09fPXcw|0|1|0

We went late on Saturday afternoon to a vibrant but not grossly crowded restaurant - and sat at the bar.  The dining rooms, patios and bar area are all decorated nicely and comfortably.  Even the floors are cool.  You can just tell that the neighborhood crowd has been dying for this place to open.  The bartender waitstaff: A-girl and M-guy, are totally friendly and awesome.  They have a nice selection of beers on tap and wines by the glass and bottle, and just bust their humps to serve everyone perfectly.    Here's a review on the food we tried:  APPETIZERS: Escargot - amazing and unique.  Totally delicious (I'm a regular snail eater). Blue Cheese Tart - delicious, but not huge.  That's alright.  I'm just letting you know in case you decide to only order that. Frites (fries) - fantastic, seasoned, and they come with shaved meat on them.  Holy Braseola! :)  FOOD: Duck three ways - the shaved duck looks weird, but is delightfully tender and tasty.  This is not a filling dish, so know that going into it.  It's not tiny, but don't expect a warm ""meal"".  The other two ways are a ""duck sausage"", if you will, and a beautifully rich pate.  Yummers. Seafood Risotto - I will be back for this asap.  Very saffrony, not too wet and not too dry, and the seafood was all cooked perfectly (I am picky about that).  Comes with 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, oysters, clams (but not too many, which I appreciate), etc.   Wonderful!  DESSERTS: A show-off guy next to us decided to buy four desserts for all of us to share.  Well, alright.   S'MORES:  Very rich looking; served like a sundae.  I didn't have any, but each person who tried it was a mess.  They had marshmallow and stickiness everywhere. (RASPBERRY) SORBET: Hands down everyone's favorite.  A generous serving, and every bite was not-too-sweet flavorful.   FLOATING ISLAND: I do not recommend the floating island.  It's just not something that you would expect from a restaurant.  It's very ""pretend food"" ish.  Yuck.  Sorry, but all four of us thought that.  I'm still not sure what it is. BEIGNETS: Plain on their own, but cooked well.  Served with three ""sauces"" (chocolate, caramel, and something white).  I'm more of a ""honey"" girl, but that's just me.  If you're a beignet fan, I don't think these will disappoint.  We will back soon.  The staff was amazing.  The place is going to be popular.  I love the vibe and the food.  Again, it's very neighborhood comfortable.  I love!"|review|Rz7qXI6Vu-fzuCViv7_veg|1|1|2

This allows us the opportunity to share dishes, something that I wouldn't do if we ate in the main dining room. The first bit of yummy deliciousness is the bread basket. I seriously have to restrain myself from filing up on just that alone. Then we usually go with the lobster mashed potatoes (pure indulgence), either fish or steak, both of which are spectacular, and some type of vegetable just to pretend we're eating healthy. And if I managed to restrain myself with the bread, I might have enough room for the scrumptious butter cake. Usually I just eat a bite or so, but those are some of the best bites I have all night. The service is almost always outstanding, even at the bar. This restaurant is expensive, but always delivers. We go quite a bit and will continue to do so.

I've been a handful of times to this CB&TL for meetings as well as stopped in to get a cup of coffee or tea before or after a visit to Triple Sports (it's right next door).  It's just nothing to write home about... Last Thursday evening, I declared this would be a meeting spot for a group of us that needed to get together to discuss an upcoming event.  It was a 5:30 meeting and I arrived a bit early to get a drink and find a table for us.  Unfortunately, there are only 3 tables that sit 4 people... the rest of the tables sit 2.  There is a loungier area that seats maybe 4 in the back as well.  Luckily, one of the 4 tops became available as I waited, but if it didn't, we would've been SOL.   I will say that I like CB&TL sugar free vanilla flavoring as well as their lemon FruTea drink - try it if you go, it's refreshing and thirst quenching... supposedly it's made from lemon extract which is why it has that tart flavor I love so much.  Overall, I can give this CB&TL 3 stars - I think that's actually pretty fair.|review|fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw|2|0|6

All of these are owned by Dr. Griego and housed under the same roof but are billed as separate businesses. I feel that this isn't a fair way to conduct business and just a way to bring in excessive amounts of money from insurances and co-pays.

The spicy bloody marys are really good.  It's usually good for what it is, I mean we're not in the state of mind to be looking for excellent food.  Everyone that works there shops at Ed Hardy with the guy from Rock of Love and wears MAC makeup and the people watching is great.  We went last weekend and ordered one of the bloody marys that has peppers and jalapenos in it (it's really good).  The girl comes back with the ""Holy Water"" ones which have onion and garlic.  They were bad and had so many chunks of onion in them you couldn't even drink them.  When she finally came back to check on us (10 min later) we told her the problem and she apologized, brought us the right ones, and comped the wrong ones.  The manager came over to talk to us...he is always nice, just not my style (eg calls my boyfriend ""Bro""). Then she left for about 15 minutes...we waited...and waited.  Then saw her filling up salt and pepper shakers! Um, there were only 2 other tables there.  She comes over and askes ""Any questions about the menu?"" Um any questions we may have had are long gone because we have been waiting FOREVER.   I ordered a breakfast sandwich, eggs over medium, add tomato slices.  My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict. Our meal comes, his was fine (by the way, they ALWAYS serve men first here, it kind of pisses me off and I always notice it, I'm pretty sure they're told to do it) My eggs were WAY over easy and surprise, surprise no tomato slices.  She brought the tomato over when I was just about done with my meal.  Thanks girl.  She tried to make conversation at the end and it was painfully awkward and forced. It would have been understandable if the place was even 1/2 full, but there were literally 2 other tables in the whole place! I mean, come on.

We just returned from our 3rd stay at Canyon Villas, which are located at 5220 Marriott Drive, Phoenix,AZ. There are several buildings with studios, 1, & 2 bedroom/2 bath Villas (like condos).  They are sold as timeshare but can also be rented by anyone & traded into by other owners.  Numerous pools, spas, recreation & the nearby Desert Ridge Shopping Center offer much to do.  The villas & resort landscaping are really beautiful.  2 bedrooms sleep up to 8 people.  1 bedroom 4, & studio 4, but studios are better for 2 people max.  Villas have a full kitchen/dining room with dishwasher, washer/dryer, & all have patio or balcony with tables/chairs.  Resort has gas BBQ's scattered around that you can use.  Most of the time you can use pools at JW also, & Marriott has a free shuttle bus that takes you over there & back & also goes to Desert Ridge shopping center which has an Albertson's Market for your food supplies.  IF YOU PLAY GOLF, THERE ARE 2 SEPARATE COURSES NEXT TO THE RESORT, WILDFIRE IS ONE & I FORGOT THE NAME OF THE OTHER.  Take the Marriott timeshare tour, they are not high pressure & you can get $100.00 in Marriott dining dollars, or Marriott Rewards points.  Most people buy with Marriott as they are the premier timeshare company & owners love the resorts.  They now sell MVC points & you have no home resort, instead of timeshare weeks. It gives you freedom of reserving your time at any of the resorts.   Lots of wildlife live in the resort, owls, quail, rabbits and more.  You will love it!

The salsa isn't my favorite, but nothing bad about it. the chips were great! (and maybe I was hungry too...) The taco plates are all around $10. I had the baja fish. The tacos were packed full and very generous portion of fish! The fish has a great crispy panko crust and the cabbage was topped with a fantastic spicy aoili. the bf had the special, which was the red snapper tacos. The server came back and said they only had enough fish for one taco so he could choose one other taco. He chose the carnitas. I tried his snapper taco, which seemed a bit fishy, but that was immediately after eating my tilapia baja taco. He liked it just fine. He also had no complaints with his carnitas taco.   I ordered a Dark and Stormy, which I was excited to see on the menu. The bartender was very generous with the rum, which is usually a good thing, but I would have liked more ginger beer. But all the drinks are only $5! Unless you're there during happy hour, in which they're even cheaper. Service was very good. Our bill came to $26 which I think is pretty darn good for 2 great meals (even took almost all the rice and beans from both our plates home for leftovers) and a cocktail. I do hope this place succeeds, as, unfortunately, many in the esplanade have not. Overall, great experience. I'll definitely be back!!|review|rlcJkEoYzuiS7iF5XfXCMA|0|0|1

Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents (my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago).   Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!    Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and they'll tell you.  Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!), Lantana (evil and will not die!), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!) and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard.   Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?  Just ask!    Need something transplanted?  Buy the pots and they'll replant your plants for you.    Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, they'll tell you how to nurse it back to health.    I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!  :)|review|9SZBVZ-mxebOVa1BlWFtWw|1|0|2
o15PeOAUzpcCl8ngk0lMHw|2008-05-26|7uoHfdjMTQUPoJKqAOC5IA|2|Blah. A friend of mine just moved to Mesa and we decided to try Thai House because a) it's close to his house and b) it got a rave review on Yelp. Well, it was not great.   We started out with the fried wontons (standard fried wontons with like 1/16th of a teaspoon of spiced ground chicken filling) and spring rolls, which were actually quite good despite the extreme stickiness of the wrappers. What really worried us, though, is that the appetizers came out about 30 seconds after we ordered them, which led us to worry that they'd been sitting around; I'm not always against pre-making food, but this place isn't busy enough to ensure rapid cycling.   For dinner, my friend ordered the red curry with chicken and I ordered the pineapple curry, which was red curry with (canned) pineapple and shrimp. Sure, we should have branched out but were just both feeling the red curry. The spiciness scale goes from 1-5 - I got a 2 and my dining companion got a 5 - I'm a total spiciness wuss and was happy with my 2, but my heat-loving friend wanted the 5 to be hotter. The curries were just okay. And maybe I'm just spoiled on Thai Basil's amazing curries, but I didn't find either curry to be all that impressive.  Furthermore, the place is SUPER tiny, which is fine, but the layout means that you're practically sitting in the laps of patrons at neighboring tables. Not fun.  So this place was fine, but nothing special. 3 stars. It's possible that the red curry just isn't that great and everything else is dynamite, but since the previous 5-star review said that the red curry was the best thing on the menu, I don't think I'll be back.|review|KCV1ql3SZl9C8QMer1K-_A|2|0|2

I allowed myself a cheat meal today, since I've been doing so well. I figured I'd check out Smashburger, being that I was at Desert Ridge. What a disaster!   I got a simple cheese burger with fries. The burger itself was jammed with salt, I didn't even want to eat it any more. I mean, did they unload the entire salt mine on that single patty??   I'm only giving this place two stars because the cashier was very friendly. Otherwise, it would've only been one star.   I might have had a jacked up patty... however, I will not be returning.

We met at Hole In The Wall and as we came in one by one from our various sides of town, there was at least a 5-7 minute wait for service PER person. We kept having to go find somebody by the pool to help us. What really was irritating was  we were at the bar! No bartender on a Sat afternoon at 3:00? The pool was open....what the hell? When we asked over and over for help, servers would just say ,""ok, ill go find someone""....none of them just stepped up and took our order.

We had dinner here last night and if felt like one thing after another. Yes, we were seated right away... at a dirty table. Ok, wiped it off, we're all good. The bread basket is like something from a presliced bag from a grocery store. The caprese starter was good but they really need to take the tomatoes out of the fridge. They were cold, hard, and a bit grainy. The presentation and size was great. We both ordered the Chicken Saltinboca the procuttio was overlooked on my husbands and mine was burnt, the noodles and sauce were very salty. To their credit the food wait time was short. Our service was *terrible*. In the beginning I said to our server I would just like water, when we left my glass was completely empty not even ice in it and had never been refilled. Not that it wasn't requested. When asked about dessert we declined because we just wanted to leave already. I cannot recommend this place to anyone. :(|review|eKs0b2xKuzkFz_zs0LX2gQ|0|0|0

I can't really express how much I loved all the food, because it really is without comparison.  We came in on a fairly slow mid-morning, demanding breakfast 2 minutes before 11. The waiter, a wonderfully nice guy, told us it was fine. The owner, who has only owned the business for 15 months, came out and visited and asked us how the food was. The answer was simple - Totally kickass.  I am a vegetarian (on accident, after watching netflix documentaries), so I have a little bit picky tastes for my vege-food. I love flavour, taste, texture, etc. I had the tofu scrambler, with veggies, eggs, cheese, potatos, and an AMAZING sourdough and I ate Every. Last. Bite.   They sent us off with to-go coffees, without us even asking, and both the waiter and the owner were incredibly entertaining. I would go back in a heartbeat!|review|9tXL9eJNIi9SL5pdCYeyZQ|0|0|4
HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw|2013-07-30|a1QYxtVi6sx-wB4fiLrSaw|3|Driving up to Butterfields, the first thing you'll notice is the crowd out the door. Not unusual for a Saturday or Sunday morning, there will be people waiting both outside and inside the restaurant. The crowd might be large, but thankfully due to the number of seats and the fast-paced staff, you typically won't need to wait more than 15 minutes.  From a pure ratings perspective, Butterfields falls right in the middle of my spots for brunch. I frequent the place because of proximity, convenience and comfort. Butterfields is all about the home-cooked style meal that leaves you happy and your stomach satisfied. There are certainly places that are worse, however if you're looking for a unique or exceptional meal, you may want to look elsewhere. This really isn't a bad thing in Butterfield's case, because I believe they are striving to reach the masses with their food. Of all the menu choices, if you are looking for something a little more unique (at least for the Scottsdale area), try the Dutch Baby, a baked pancake of sorts.  This past visit, I had the chicken scrambler with fruit and potatoes. As with most other breakfast places, the portions are quite large here as well. The flavors overall were good, however one complaint I have was that there was too much filler put into the eggs. A lot of restaurants use milk or cream to make the eggs more fluffy, however in this case there was a little too much added. The eggs tasted a bit diluted.  I'll continue going to Butterfields because of the comfort. I'll continue trying different items on their menu, but I feel confident that it will keep consistent with my experience there. For most, that's really not a bad thing.  [This review is based on my visit on July 27, 2013]|review|9dHHtgu5OhOjibf780dd_w|1|1|3

I just got back from Phoenix and my tenant told me that he had a really hard time renting the property as Simply property management was unresponsive to his requests to see the house for over 2 weeks.  He finally had to call his real estate person and have them show him the house.  Then he said that Simply property management was mad at him since they needed to pay him a commission.  Simply property management sent in maintenance people to do some calking and they stood on the toilet seat breaking the seat and bolts, then they charged me for the broken seat. Although I had personally gone down and cleaned the house with a cleaning service, when the tenant finally saw the house he said it was dirty with hair all over the stairs....it looked like someone had stayed there or had a long haired animal (possibly a workman?). Also, they were supposed to have a refrigerator put in, and they charged me a delivery charge, charged double for the refrigerator, but while delivering it, it fell or was dropped leaving a huge dent in the top and was VERY dirty. REMEMBER, it is now April.  They collected rent and deposits in January and I have still not received one cent!!!!  No matter what they say, collecting money from a tenant and not sending it to the owner is NOT acceptable.  They continue to hold my money hostage, saying they are going to charge an early termination fee and a year of ""computer"" charge even though THEY CANCELLED ME!

Well, we are in the desert, so I think that's just the way it goes. Nevertheless, I think it's a pretty cool place to walk around and enjoy the outdoors on a nice day. I really like the butterfly exhibit when that's going on - usually in the spring. I have yet to go to a night time exhibit, but really want to check out the flash light tours (available during the summer months) and the luminarias (at Christmas time.) Great deals on admission can be found on groupon every so often, or you can get free admission if you're able to snag a culture pass at the library.

First, let me say that I have worked in the food and beverage industry for over 10 years, and customer service plays a big role in this environment. We order our usual meals and find a place to sit; my girlfriend immediately notices two black hairs in the cheese of her meal. She takes her taco plate back to the cashier, points out the hairs and that she believes it may have come from the cheese. The staff begins to show each other the plate, and laugh about the fact that there was hair found in a guest's meal, in front of more guests standing along the assembly line. They begin to make her meal again, but continue to use the same products as before, regardless that any may have human hair in them, even the cheese that was specifically pointed out to be the most likely culprit. I give this place 2 stars because normally, the standard of service is very high. This time,  I did not recognize a single person on the line, so I'm giving fault to inexperienced employees. Very poor customer service, not even an apology or offer to pay for the meal was given. I will now be driving to other locations as this one has lost its luster and appeal from poor management, food quality and customer service.|review|er0hbynrnW4YaIJknvXN1Q|0|0|0

Nice selection of beers, although it was a mistake to order a pitcher instead of just individual pints (Honey Bunny and I don't knock 'em back like we used to). Fed a party of 3 for $40 including tip. Not too bad.  We sat at the counter on comfortable office type chairs. Their footprint was a little large so we locked wheels a couple of times but otherwise it was a much better experience than sitting in traditional theater style chairs. So nice not to have to share an armrest. There are chairs with their own built in tables and big ol' LazyBoy style recliners that I'd be afraid of falling asleep in.

I had a hard time deciding what to get becasue it all looked so exotic and interesting. I ended up getting a #24 SANDWICH CUBANO (Slowly roasted pork, ham slices, Swiss cheese, pickle chips, and mustard, pressed and toasted  $8.95) with a side of  fried yucca wedges (included).  It was delicious.    I still don't know what fried Yucca is but they were so good I ate them all and was only able to finish half my sandwich.  I saved the rest till the next day for lunch and it was excellent then, too.  The meat could have been a little more tender, as I love me some tender pork, but the flavor was so good it made up for that.  Now I want to go back and maybe just get a bowl of the soup--(#13 POTAJE DE GARBANZOS Garbanzo beans simmered to perfection with our special seasonings, pork, potatoes, and Spanish chorizo.

I am a big guy and can eat my fair share but this is almost to much for me to eat in one sitting, you could easily split one in half and share it. The staff is friendly and welcoming, while we were waiting we were given a sample of home made lentil soup that was simply amazing and a terrific start to a great meal. I wish other places had this level of quality and customer appreciation. Its a little out of the way for me, but well worth the trip every time. It tops the standard by which Gyros should be judged.|review|o1RXCUoikkUribU0lKtFIg|0|0|2

UE4h9OXNzNInmxseAkUihw|2010-11-18|bqh3mv7YemAxp-G4OGkmKQ|3|I like Thai Basil and come here pretty often as it is easy for me to walk here on my lunch break between classes or call for take out on my way home or for a quick dinner. I generally stick to a few basic things with the curry dishes (panang curry being a favorite of mine) and tom-kah soup. I mix it up with what meat i get in things but usually chicken in my curries and beef in soup.  I tend to order my foods hot which is very spicy in the soup but not so bad in the curries. They pack good flavor especially the soup but the meats just seem off in the curries, they don't seem to have the right flavor or texture.  The beef in the soup is perfect however and melts in the mouth. The other thing i have noticed is when i have ordered other curry dishes that have potatoes they seem to lack flavor and don't absorb the curry like i am used to. The one time I ordered a non-curry dish i got the eggplant garlic which had great flavor but sadly lacked on the eggplant.  I do love the lunch specials here at $7 for a meal that is an entree with rice and a little spring roll it sure beats an over priced meal at the MU or McDonalds next door for the same price. I keep coming back because it's convenient and fills a craving for thai food and my spicy side. Honestly i could have the tom-kah soup with beef all the time as that spicy coconut soup is just perfect. Yet for a complet Thai meal with a curry dish and soup Thai Elephant is my go too.|review|XeoAojoz5johV2MQ5ngNig|0|0|1

The atmosphere is nice, they played a mix from early punk, 90's rock, some 80's mix. I feel like this would be a great place to come back to when the weather is nicer to sit outside on their patio, very hip and relaxed, though the decor was very clean and traditional.   The bathrooms were something less to be desired, the family (bigger) bathroom was flooded, the girl's bathroom was dirty, had no toilet seat covers and didn't have a toilet paper holder either. The giant roll was just placed on the back of the toilet. Grateful I had something to wipe with, but the whole bathroom experience could've been much better with some basic necessities.  The service experience was just okay. The waitress didn't help or offer any suggestions while we surveyed the menu and she was super slow to come back and check on us.  The sushi, I'm sad to say, didn't have any zing that would make me want to pick this joint over something much closer to my house. IF they had any signature rolls, our less-than-helpful waitress did not point them out, which is sad, because they lost a great opportunity to shine.   I wish our waitress would've explained that their Vegas roll wasn't deep fried like most restaurants. No, they do something very different, and it would've been nice to know because I wouldn't have ordered it. Instead, I was disappointed because it wasn't what I was expecting or wanted.   I will be back Sushi Room...I'm going to see if your entrees are better than the rolls. I also hope I get a better server next time around.|review|s8fJCSltyub39Q1dqzjb6g|0|0|0

I had a tasty french dip, my hubby had another sandwich (can't remember) and my daughter had a cheesy grilled cheese.  She liked the pickle the best though.  I will say the next best thing to those cookies was the tomato bisque soup.  I will definitely stop in again for that!

The food is that of a high-end steakhouse. The atmosphere is similar to a bar or soup kitchen.

Sushi is in really skimpy portions and not even that good to where spending that much for that little is worth it. I have been to some good sushi places that pack a punch in a 4 piece roll. The soft shell crab was okay, but only 4 pieces?!?!!?!?! Like most of their other sushi it was really salty....REALLY REALLY REALLY SALTY. the wasabi had zero potency. The scallops was chopped up...booo, some other places do that too, the worst part was how much salt there was on it. they should have called that a salt roll with a hint of scallops.. BLECH!!!  I also ordered ton katsu curry...soo i got this because someone was raving about it. like the wasabi the curry lacked in the spice category, a lot. Not only that but the pork cutlet was so dried out...  and the panko also no spice at all and what in the world, had no flavor at all. it was like eating deepfried mush.   my over all rating.....2 because the staff was nice and friendly, otherwise i recommend going somewhere else for sushi/japanese food.. their spicy _""enter random fish name here""___ rolls all taste the same...super fail....and they weren't...yeah you guessed they weren't spicy at all"|review|IjafRfMSAQpInLlw-Vi0Cg|0|0|3

I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.  In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.  Overall I'd like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)|review|sQwgFhirdCt6h_g1rbjHHA|0|0|2

There was a pretty good sized meat selection, including marinated steak, which I chose. For seasoning, there were some pretty tempting choices, and I went with a couple shakes of black pepper, citrus garlic herb, and crushed red pepper. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and surprisingly potatoes went on next, followed by some mongo barbecue, Szechuan, and honey soy sauces, and noodles.  The carrots were maybe a little too thick and crunchy, not quite cooked through, but other than that, everything was all good.  The bowl was a little small (you don't put the noodles on yourself, so you don't need a huge bowl), but I think I managed to get a decent sized meal into it. I probably could have put a little more meat in there, but I'll remember that for next time.  Personally, I prefer the YC's experience, just because it's simpler, faster, and gives you a little more food for a little less money. But I don't have any complaints about this place.|review|el_BsZHqhCZK_VG27TyPBA|0|0|0

Being country dancers we were hoping to tear up the dance floor every night we were in town. All we got was more and more frustrated at the entire experience! The country dj, completely out of sight or reach had no clue the concept of playing to the crowd or even knowledge of country club music! Meaning...knowing the difference between a 2-step, shuffle, shadow, west coast swing, or east coast swing...which btw not only did he only played 1 east coast swing all night Saturday  but ZERO waltz's! The song selection although current top 40 hits (surprisingly, because the line dances all but 2 were from the past 20 years done to the even more tired original songs from 20 years ago) was more like a bad juke box! no format whatsoever and the transitions were horrible...cutting off songs before they ended as the next song was abruptly forced in. Upon making requests, we were told, ""ok, I think I have it"" yet we never heard them! Now, I can understand club Djs not taking requests, but in all the country clubs I've been to, and this includes rodeos and other gay country dance events for the past 15 years, requests are very crucial to keeping and making your guests feel welcome and included! Especially if they are songs or dances that will show the locals something new they might like to try!  Now that's just the music! The dance floor etiquette was non existant! They have let the drunk queens take over the dance floor way before the music even switched over, not caring one bit about the couples or dancers trying to menuver around them! Only once were they told not to bring drinks to the dance floor, but never to get their drunk asses out of the way before they get intentionally plowed into by people that are fed up with it!  The patio was useless for non smokers! The dance floor is way too small for a club that brings in as many people as this one does! What a wasted use of space where the volleyball court is! That! Should be the dance floor!  The only saving grace was catching up with old rodeo friends, and the taco truck!  So, this club, along with the no dance floor and ridiculous all day entertainment at the rodeo grounds has reassured my friend and myself will NOT be returning next year!"|review|4YweeTxGRVQm3qw9lYcz2Q|0|0|1

Very open kitchen with neat seating/tables.  The guacamole is very good, and they make it for you fresh at the table. Good acidity of the lime juice balanced by the buttery, tasty texture of the avocado.  Low on the onions, which is good - I'm not a huge onion fan when it comes to guacamole. The chips are good, but not the best I've ever had.  They do come in a cool cone basket though.  The tortilla soup is also very good. The bring the chicken and tortilla in the bowl, and bring the steaming soup broth in a ceramic jar, pouring it into the bowl to make the soup.  The soup was creamy, spicy (not overly), and quite pleasant.  Big pieces of shredded chicken.  Salads were okay, but not great.  I had the chicken quesadilla, which were two quesadillas (one corn and one flour) filled with jack and oaxacan cheeses and shredded chicken.  Tasty and filling.  The maple glazed salmon is also very good - sweet and well prepared.  The service was friendly, but was not the fastest service, so plan for a longer dinner.|review|rs0V36Mu3BMZ0SGbey2sVg|0|0|0

I was going to wait a month or two and try it again before Yelping, but after reading all the reviews I had to speak up. Let me just get this out of the way...soft opening...blah blah blah... OK, now that we've moved past that.  The service is a complete disaster.  It was 20+ minutes, no joke, before we got water and ONE menu to share between the three of us.  After waiting that long for a menu we decided to play it ""smart"" and just order three appetizers and a beer.  My beer came 15 minutes later.  I ordered another one immediately, I never got the second beer. About 45 minutes after ordering the food came. We asked the girl that brought it what each item was, she said she had to go get our bill (to identify your own apps? really?) and disappeared.  She came back and said she couldn't find our bill and had to find our waitress (good luck!) to ID the apps. Really? The food did NOT make up for the service. Far from it.  The deep fried scallops sucked, could have reheated a box or pre-frozen scallops from the supermarket, thanks.  The rest of the food was uninteresting at best. We told two random girls we had somewhere we needed to be (I'm like 2 damn hours in at this point, the waitress never came to ID the food) and wanted our check.  They said ""I can't find it, I have to find your waitress.""  20 or so more minutes pass, still no check or waitress, we finally get loud so the waitress comes and asks what we need.  We say ""Our check!""  Five minutes later she comes back and comps our meal.   I may not be able to give it a second chance, but other chefs have told me how awesome the head chef is supposed to be.  So I may go back and try the sushi, but it would have to be amazing.  Let me say something here, Otaku is a STRONG word.  I have a shirt that says Super Otaku I bought in Tokyo.  That word means ""Nerd"".  When applied to food especially, you are making a HUGE commitment.  That only made the experience that much worse.  They should change their name to whatever is Japanese for ""Mildly Interested In."""|review|u9DqYkDeNQF5zFwj2WsSWw|0|0|0

Thus we decided to hang out at Gameworks. This was my first experience at Gameworks. For the most part, I hung out in the upstairs bar while a few friends played games downstairs. (Well drinks were $5. They had a crazy cocktail menu, but no prices.) I really wanted to play air hockey, but it was broken. My husband played a shoot-em-up and then we played a round of Mario. To play games, you must purchase a game card. The card itself costs $2, then you can load whatever dollar amount you want. I didn't actually purchase the card, so I wasn't sure how many points equaled a dollar, since you use points/credits when you play a game. (Mario was one credit per player, but the claw machine was 13 credits.) Overall, there was a mix of adults and few children actually playing. Some of the machines seemed really old and like they had taken a beating. (Again, a few others were broken or in need of repair.) Overall, it was an easy way to pass the time before a movie but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.|review|tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww|2|0|5

The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the yogurt is thick, creamy deliciousness. I'm not sure what would make this a 5 star place for me. I think perhaps the fact that the owner knows that I am a president for a non-profit and he's constantly after me to have a fundraiser with them makes me feel a bit put upon whenever I go there. I go in hoping he's not there to solicit me. I guess that takes away from the experience. If not for that, I think I'd give it 5 stars. :)|review|kG8jkVFgOAOq6Ht6RvAjEQ|0|0|0

The bread with jelly was delicious as well as the pork beans.  BBQ ribs were pretty decent but not the best ever. The ham and chicken were more in the average spectrum. It seems that they use canned pineapple for the ham, which is super sweet and gives an artificial flavor. The ham was also a little too dry. The chicken can be skipped.

Went for lunch yesterday and was not so pleased, here's why:  Our server was not on top of things, he did not fully explain the special, only noticed this when I overheard another waitress describing it.  I ordered the Blackened fish sandwich(mahi-mahi) (see pics) I chose to have the Vegetable of the day which he told me was roasted spaghetti squash.  The fish itself was very good, the sauce however had a weird herb or spice that just didn't sit right with me and the squash was riddled with raisins and pistachios (that would have been nice to know beforehand) it was also barely warm.   My husband ordered the Balsamic Rib-eye with mashed potatoes (see pics) I tasted it it had a great flavor and he loved it! The mashed potatoes however were lukewarm at best.......sigh........ I ate the tomatoes that came on his plate and they were the best part of the meal, so sweet and juicy drizzled with balsamic Yum!  We  Finally got a refill on our soda when we had only a few bites of food left! Our little waiter was too busy pretending to be cool holding up the bar.

The wife and daughter were already there, sitting in the reception area - apparently they could not be seated because my daughter had a cup of iced coffee from one of those coffee places.  She said they told her she could not be bringing in outside ""food"".  Ok, I get it.  But really?  a coffee drink?  This is a bit petty if you asked me.  Geez.  A good restauranteur would offer to transfer the drink to one of their own glasses so she could still enjoy it.  You know, this review could have been four stars, but for this, I'm taking one off.  I can understand if she brought in a whole meal from Taco Time or something, but a coffee drink?  Can you say ubiquitous?  Ok, rant over.  She ended up tossing her drink so we could be seated.  Our table was ready, and chips and salsa were quickly delivered, shortly after the waittress came by to take our drink order.  The rest of our party had not arrived, but it was not a problem for them.  Kudos on this.    The salsa was chunky and mild, good flavored, but a hotter option from a restaurant named ""Serranos"" would be appropriate.  Along with the salsa came a bowl of bland bean dip - I dunno, maybe some cheese or red sauce mixed in to liven it up?  Eventually, the remainder of our party filtered in, and the waittress was very gracious in giving us time to get acclimated and figure out what we wanted to order.  I had a shredded Pork Chimi enchalada style with the same tasteless beans.  it also came with rice, but I don't eat Mexican rice, so I cannot comment on that, other than it was all mixed in with my beans.  I'm not a divider-plate kinda guy, and the beans really weren't worth saving, so it wasn't a big deal.    The chimi came with a delicious chunky guacamole and ""seasoned"" sour cream.  I think they just added some white pepper to the sour cream.  It was ok.  The chimi was big and crispy, but the pork filling was dry and had little flavor beyond pork.  The combination of the green sauce, guacamole and sour cream saved it.  The wife had a relleno, as did the MIL, the MIL complained that the rellano should have been crispy but was drowning in sauce, and so lost much of it's appeal.  The wife had no comment.  Others seemed to be ok with their dishes, although nobody really raved.  Overall, this is not a place I would make a special trip to visit, and I might be inclined to suggest a different place in the area, like maybe Top Shelf, but the food was ok and the prices were not bad.  Dinner for eight came in around $130 with tip."|review|J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ|0|0|1

It's tucked away on 1st Avenue in Scottsdale, and on this cool and rainy evening, we felt very comfortable. It's prix fixe, $45, plus drinks. We enjoyed the salad and then had the two choices for entree - scallops and pork osso buco. Each dish was prepared perfectly, and the desert was excellent, too. The waiter was good - and the only quibble is that that fellow picking up plates as we finished stopped 3 times to ask if we were done, when we were clearly not. Once is fine, 3 times is not good training. The bill came just as I took my last sip of coffee - also a bit rushed. Everything else was well paced and done well, and the rest of the evening was wonderful. Enjoy! Recommended for a special evening.|review|2BzcoI6Kiq-2RQ9EUFR5Tw|0|0|0

Eating at this modest restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip to Phoenix.  I implore all Phoenicians to frequent this establishment and your taste buds will thank you.  For starters, the chips were wonderfully light and not too oily.  The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado.   I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.  My dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.    The perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.  The tortillas were right on and looked to be homemade.

We decided to try for lunch and were told the plates were small so we ordered three  plates to share but really two plates would be enough.  We started with the grilled tofu salad,with udon noodles, cucumber, and greens. The tofu was marinated and very lightly grilled and it, along with the noodles picked up most of the flavor of the dressing. ($8)  The short rib steamed buns were like sandwiches not stuffed like buns and had precision cut Tokyo Negi (onion) inside them with house made pickles (celery) the meat in the bun had a most perfect tasty char but was also marinated and for some people the taste of the marinate is an acquired taste,don't misunderstand it was good but fish essence was part of the flavor. The steamed fresh bun was the best I ever had and we were served two sandwiches so again this was a generous portion. ($8)  The most impressive bursting with pleasing flavors plate we had was the panko fried soft shell crab on house made foccia served with side of fennel cole slaw. Perfect in preparation,great pops of taste with kanzuri aiol (Asian red pepper paste) I think purple shiso herb (minty fennel like basil) and cucumber sandwich. My only thought is this was perfect and didn't need the dressing on both sides of sandwich. The house made focaccia bun was so light and fresh and the herb that was used under the top bun that I think was shiso transformed and elevated the taste tremendously. The fennel cole slaw was the best I ever had and was like fireworks in your mouth it was delicious. ($10)  some plates are a whisper and some plates are a scream, service was exceptionally good. The menu is limited so you need to examine before you dine.|review|p7dvahRPZIWL7T6pFA_0dg|1|1|1

When we got there we had to wait for the wait staff to find a table.  For a Thursday night the place didn't seem busy but the wait staff couldn't handle the crowd.  After several minutes getting soaked by the misters we finally got a table.  Several minutes later we received our waters and several minutes after that we finally got our Sangria.  The host/waiter seemed very flustered even though the place did not seem too busy.  For my meal I decided on the Organic Spinach Salad.  The salad was perfect for such a warm night.  The bacon citrus vinaigrette dressing and goat cheese were a perfect combination!!    I have heard so many wonderful things about Fuego but my experience was not the best.  The host/waiter kept apologizing which didn't help the situation.  The food was amazing and I will probably go back to give this local place another shot.|review|2h0A-NirfNl2p2SquFWYHQ|1|0|1
IVc23uY-36WUNYoIbz42Fg|2009-02-17|OHTiXTNfgDRq0NDVgtP11Q|4|Stumbled upon Switch for lunch last week and what a pleasant stumble it was! The atmosphere felt reminiscent of FEZ also located in central Phoenix and also one of my fave dives. I asked someone and sure enough, it was. So I knew I was going to have a fantastic lunch.   The 3 of us arrived in the heat of lunch hour but were seated quickly....a mere 5 minutes. Our server arrived promptly and took our drink orders. The Sangria was calling my name but I decided to behave and order iced tea instead. Two of us ordered iced tea and my server was insightful enough to bring a carafe.  Cool points for this. I hate waiting for refills!   The problem with a menu in which everything sounds good, you can't decide on anything! And I couldn't decide! So with desperation in my eyes, I asked my server for a suggestion. He recommended the APRICOT BBQ CHICKEN SANDWICH w/ warm sliced chicken, shredded spinach, cilantro and red onion on warm ciabatta bread. OMG! This sandwich was so flippin' good! You know....it tasted like a bbq chicken pizza ....but as a sandwich. There! That's the best description. Biting in is wonderfully messy though...ask for extra napkins.   My colleagues ordered the CLASSIC HAMBURGER and the COUNTRY CLUB TURKEY PANINI. Both delicious. But my sandwich took home the prize by far!   Lunch hour ran like a well oiled machine. No super long waits for seating, service or food. Things you appreciate when short on time.

For me, Oink is great alternative to IHOP (meh) and Chompie's (good, but overwhelming). It's a locally-owned neighborhood spot for a good breakfast in an intimate setting. We've never had an issue with the food or the service. When we were there last month the owner was walking to each table, talking to customers, and just making sure they/we were ok. This morning we went with friends and the GM was doing the same thing. He stopped at our table, made a genuine effort to talk to us and our kids (making a big to-do about hanging their pig pictures on the wall), and made sure we were well taken care of. Stuff like this goes a long way with me, and is a big reason why I will keep coming back. I always order the Pig in a Blanket which never disappoints. Love this place! There have been so many restaurants come and go in this space over the years. . . .I hope this one stays for a while.|review|mZ0TyyeMTXnbPPPJgVctuw|0|0|0

I have had the different brushettas here - the marscapone & fig, salami & pesto, and smoked salmon ones being some of my favorites.  I've also had the mini grilled cheese appetizers (so GOOD), the big plate appetizer (can't remember the name but it comes with hummus, cheeses, and prosciutto and salamis) and the old burratta plate.  Very, very good.  I am a huge cheese, wine, and brushetta person so this place is literally my heaven.  The only thing I'm knocking a star off for is the staff.  I've been there a few times and some of the staff could be rude and snobby, and one instance that irked me was when I talked to the server about adding burratta to my order, he basically charged me for the whole plate (burratta, olives, salamis, etc) and didn't add it on to the big appetizer plate, like I thought he would.  No big deal, I just wished that he would have explained it was a separate appetizer plate since we had so much food!  Overall, still my favorite place in Phoenix.|review|NGFk3rOFXXii9glKLoZQHg|1|0|1
5SS69rC8XWvdlD1OHifEEQ|2011-06-03|F3Iqs82sNYkChrxkmrQ40w|4|First things first. Can anyone say the name 'Beaver Choice' without snickering a little behind their hand?   Ok, now that I've gotten that out of my system, I adore Beaver Choice! Today was our second experience with them and it is quickly becoming a favorite.   This is not a restaurant to judge by appearances because, let's face it, the appearance is anything but high class. From the awkward beaver paintings on the front windows (at least I THINK that thing is a beaver...), to the flimsy dining tables and chairs, to the artwork on the walls that range from nice floral paintings to 'I'm bored and I'm going to paint a color tornado!'. I'm not a huge stickler for ambiance in a restaurant, but this place could definitely use a face-lift.   BUT   The food is the real story here and it is definitely worth writing home about. They have a fairly decently sized menu with with items for the faint-of-heart and adventurous palette alike. On this particular trip, my friend had the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu ($10.75). One look at their website and you know that they are proud of this puppy, and justifiably. The combination of perfectly crispy, brown schnitzel, brie and ham is divine. Her only complaint was that it was a little too greasy.   I opted for Jansson's Temptation ($10.75). Mind you, I'm the kind of person who tends to gravitate towards the most seemingly unusual item on the menu.  We're talking anchovies, potatoes, onions and cream all baked into a surprisingly delicious treat. It is not very fishy at all, but is really more like a rich hash with hints of salt from the anchovies. It was perhaps a little overdone (the top was more crispy than I would have liked), but I would absolutely order it again. I found it particularly amusing that the owner felt it necessary to come out and check on me a few times to make sure I liked it. I promise, Ma'am, it was wonderful! The only reason I only ate half was because it was huge and very heavy. I'm thinking that other half is going to end up a midnight snack.   If you want something similar but aren't quite up for anchovies yet, try the Laxpudding ($10.75), which is sort of like a potato fritter with salmon. I had it last time and it is also outstanding, especially with the amazing mustard that was served with it. I have no idea what that mustard was, but I want more!   In addition to the already massive entrees, you get a side and three salads. I won't go into much on these, because they are pretty straight forward. You know what green beans are. No surprises. However, when you order, you are doing yourself a GRAVE disservice if you fail to order the tomato-basil salad. Perhaps my favorite thing on the entire menu. It is extraordinarily fresh and the combination of herbs and oil make it completely to die for. In fact, for my side salads this time, I got broccoli and two orders of the tomato-basil salad. Next time? Probably three.   Finally, we finished off our meal by sampling the beaver balls ($1 each) and the beaver cookies ($1.50 each). The beaver balls were ok. Honestly, not much more to say about them than that. They were chocolate, so you can't go wrong there, but other than that, kind of boring. The beaver cookies, were a complete surprise. I haven't the first idea what kind of cookies they are, but they had a slightly caramel flavor to them and they were a light, crispy texture. Looking at them, I expected them to be crunchier, but they were just perfect. Sandwiched between the two cookies is a lime-y cream that was very tart and smooth and complimented the cookie perfectly. They were a wonderful way to round off a great meal.   Beaver Choice has recently started a loyalty program. I would recommend joining up, even if it's just your first visit. Don't worry. You'll be back.|review|qrh6S_JXkZQjMeCIDVFYcA|1|1|3

I thought it was pretty neat for the atmosphere with a big long horn outside, the crazy decor, a live band playing country tunes, a big slide for kiddies to goof off on. I could go on and on, the place is just neat in a silly sort of way.  The food was sort of meh. We ordered the rattle snack appetizer which tasted like fried (insert whatever here). I would have to like to have found out what rattlesnake really tasted like, I already know what fried (insert whatever here) tastes like thank you very much. The stuff was like 20 something dollars too, phew glad that work was picking up the tab!  For my entree I had the rib steak. It's wasn't very good quality but it was passable. I thought a place like this would have had better quality steaks though.  The place is pretty cool though. If I ever find myself back in Phoenix with my family I would bring them here because the place is pretty cool.|review|SiaTCYgIDCcJ_zgwayvNVA|0|0|0

Take a friend or expect to take the extras with you; the portions are sizable.  Overall, the food is a refreshing option.

You can get lamb, beef, and chicken--and they have liver, tongue, kidneys, tripe, and anything else you might need that you can't typically find at Safeway. The best part is that the meat is local and the beef is grass fed. The quality of the meat is excellent and the prices are reasonable--frequently lower than Safeway, which they easily pass in quality. If you want excellent, grass fed beef, you're way better off coming to Baiz than going to Whole Foods.  There's a little restaurant/cafe inside and they sell excellent thyme and spinach and meat pies, as well as shawarma (beef and chicken), hummus, fatoush salad, and lots of other excellent dishes.   They also have really good deals on spices and lots of other Middle Eastern staples like feta, labna, dates, dried figs, orange and rose blossom water, pomegranate syrup, fresh mint leaves, goat cheese, and more. The bakery has fresh pita as well as injera (Ethiopian flat bread). I love this place, but the butcher counter really takes it to the next level.|review|C17A410Qb6_GX0p8VZsZ1g|1|0|0

I haven't had the opportunity to get a full meal there yet, but the food smells delicious and looks soo appetizing each time I visit, so that's on the to do list for the next stop in.  I have to highly suggest the creme brulee- so far it's my favorite dessert item. The plating of everything makes all the dishes look like masterpieces!

Best of all was the lamb cubes: generous portion of meaty chunks.  Some places skimp of the toppings and meat and leave much to be desired but Cyprus Grill gives you the bang for your buck.  On the night I was here there must have been a call off or two as one woman was left to operate the cash register and serve the tables.  There was a wait but this lady handled it like a champ and kept her composure.  My friend said this place is typically staffed well so the longer wait was not the norm.  Props to this gal for taking it all in stride.  I was also impressed with the tropical tea they served.  It had passion fruit or some other tropical fruit that I'd never expect to find in tea but it was very good and refreshing after spending the day out in the sun.

This is a review of this particular store's ability to function during Black Frid...er...Thanksgiving, a.k.a. the worst shopping experience I've ever seen, even compared to other Black Friday madness.   Okay, so doors are open all day, but no one is allowed to have anything discounted until 6pm, in which sales are conducted in intervals of two hours. This is obviously bullshit, but it's not unique to this store, so I'm not giving them one star for that.   Fine print on ads reads that tickets may be given out in advance to shoppers who get there early to wait. However, this is at the management's discretion, and staff wouldn't disclose whether or not they'd participate. Additionally, they pick and choose which items to give out tickets for. This is dumb.   So here's what really grinds my gears:  -The Black Friday map was inaccurate. While it says ""laptops here"", only half of them were in that actual location. The other half were on the other side of the store, with no way to figure it out without stumbling upon it.   -Police were getting aggressive with shoppers, blatantly misinterpreting store policy. ""If you don't have a ticket, you can't get this item! Leave!"" They straight up yelled at someone to get away for no reason, even though there were coupons shoppers could pick up to pay for their item now and have it shipped later. I cannot stress enough how terrible it is to be intimidated by law enforcement for doing nothing wrong.   -When picking up a voucher, shoppers have to pay for the item at the cashier, and have it shipped later. That's awesome for people who don't like to literally camp in parking lots. However, management CHOSE to open up ONLY TWO registers for these vouchers, forcing what looked like 80% of the traffic into two lines that easily took 90 minutes. My friends took their vouchers to a different location to avoid this crap.   This used to be my go-to spot for busy holiday shopping. It felt like a location not a lot of people went to for more expensive items. NEVER. AGAIN."|review|jdeNI5TTTuM6mj3HTgstRA|2|2|2

The veggies were saturated in oil and over cooked. Another thing that I wish I checked in the beginning of the meal was the bathroom.

We were going to Bookmans and thought this might be a good quick stop for something other then tacos and burgers.  Watching some of the LA Angels baseball games on TV this past summer made me think of Wienerschnitzel and their 50 year celebration.  After eating here, I cannot imagine how they lasted that long.    The only other hot dog chain which I have eaten is Nathan's Famous.  Even though Nathan's has it's own short comings, they at least have a product you might actually want to eat, other than at 2 o'clock in the morning.  This is a hot dog place, plain and simple. They serve Oscar Meyer type hot dogs, though that might be a disservice to Oscar Meyer.  There is something about their Original hot dog that seems lighter, or air filled.  When I mentioned lighter, I mean that they weights next to nothing.  The bun weights more.  Combined with it's lack of taste, you wonder what you were eating.  In a blindfolded test, you would never guess.  For the record, we had couple of Original Hot Dogs, a Polish sandwich Meal deal (which was much better then the dogs), Jalapeno Poppers, Chili fries and two sodas which all amazingly came to $12 or so for the two of us.  They also charge 25 cents extra for a second ranch dressing for the poppers.  Six poppers and only one sauce?    The employees behind the counter were fine.  They were not a factor in on our decision to skip this place in the future.  In the end, it was just the food that was tasteless and uninspiring.  Admitedly, we did not try their Angus beef hot dogs.  So maybe we were missing something from the Weinerschnitzel experience.  Ehh!|review|1BW2HC851fJKPfJeQxjkTA|3|1|4

I went out as a single, as I wanted to try some of Scottsdale's more traditional courses before my golf buddies came down for their winter visits.  Last time they came down, we played desert courses.  This is a fairly easy course, with a few water hazards and numerous bunkers - both fairway and greenside.  Each fairway is fairly straight with a few gentle dog legs.  The rough is predominately grass, although there are cattails around the water hazards.  The course was in fairly good condition for this time of the year, although the greens were fairly spotty.  It is an older course, and could use some maintenance.  The employees were friendly, and the starter, and marshals kept the pace flowing.  A couple of notes.  It does have GPS in the carts, which is really helpful - and they allow driving on the fairways with the 90 degree rule.  Secondly, it is one of the few courses I have played that has the sand rake in the cart (so if oyu end up in a bunker - remember to take the rake).  The only downside was one of the people that was with our group thought he was Tiger.  He would drop out of bunkers, out of unplayable lies, take second shots and play the best one, and then ask ""did anyone else have a par?"".  It was a good thing the rest of us were even tempered - otherwise they may have found a body in one of  the bunkers.  The golf value during the summer is great.  But I would hesitate recommending this course at the more expensive winter rates, unless some major upgrades were made."|review|w_hcSjqLeSZQL9Rx1UP-Tw|1|2|1

Love this store. Do 3/4 of my shopping there, easy.  I like the small size.  And their liquor/wine/beer price + selection ratio usually can't be beat.  Except for this location.  Not sure if being in ""Mormon-town"" Mesa has anything to do with, or not, but the selection is less extensive compared to other Trader Joe's I've been to.    Regardless, I'll never forget this party I was at in LA, years ago, where I met this guy who was a beverage distributor.  I was raving about Trader Joes and he just started shaking his head.  I asked what's wrong and all he said was ""Man, those guys beat me up on price so bad, I won't even deal with them anymore.""  So there you have it.  Trader's Joes beats the stuffing out of the evil distributor middle-man and passes the saving on to you.   Other benefits include helpful staff, inexpensive flesh flowers, and the tasty free sample shack."|review|A3jj7qoDEhu295hYNFP_Pg|2|2|2

What a great deal!  The spa itself is magnificent - it was immaculate and every detail was perfect.  I especially loved the large privacy showers with the rain shower heads.  The spa pool is the best hideout!  No kids, and very quiet and relaxing.  The gym was also spectacular - very well-equipped.    We enjoyed our massages but there was nothing ""special"" about mine.  Also, I don't think I would have felt comfortable paying their prices if not for the special we took advantage of.

If you speed by North 2nd Avenue and West Roosevelt Street in Downtown Phoenix, not only will you get a speeding ticket but you will definitely miss out on one of the hole in the wall restaurants in Phoenix.   I tried their Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb, which came with the Chorizo and Manchego Risotto, and it was to die for. My wife was not a wine drinker but had their sweet red wine (forgot the name but found in AJ's Food Market on Central/Camelback) and she wanted the some for her next house party. The other dishes we had were the Spinach, Brie, & Grapes, Blackberry Spinach Salad, White Truffle Pizza and Meatballs Marsala. My mouth and tummy was very happy that night...Thank you Centurion!!!  Great customer service and place was very small. Definitely need to set a reservation ahead of time before coming here. BUT! NEWS FLASH! Our waitress stated they were going to extend the place and will occupy the business space to their west (unknown when they will begin this project).

As far as food, my husband and I only had a hotdog each (the $3 ones) and they were great! Beers were a little pricey, $11 for a tall can of Dos Equis.

But when you have a girlfriend with two daughters who have been wanting to come here for ever, it's worth seeing how excited they get.  So this place is roughly a ton of jewelry, purses, necklaces and a ton of other small trinket type things.  What's cool about it is that everything seems to be color coordinated.  So if you were looking for something black, they literally had a black section.. a yellow section.. a purple section, etc.   Very cool idea.  According to my girlfriend, the prices were ridiculously cheap.  She bought a purse and expected to pay $75, but it was only $25.    There are only a few locations that Ive seen.. one downtown and this location way up north.  Very cool and I know we're looking to bring the girls back here so they can pick a few things out.

d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw|2010-11-16|a2GNvEMDoDVz3HLYO2d6XQ|5|Carolina's: My go-to mexican place, hands down. I have been to this place many times, and I will keep going back. My way of judging a Mexican food place is by the Tortilla. If they have a delicious, self-made, fresh tortilla, things are promising and that is exactly what Carolina's has. They have their awards on the wall for all the times they have been voted Best Tortilla in Phoenix, in case you don't wanna take my word for it.  On to the food. I absolutely LOVE the food here! I have yet to try anything here that I didn't love. The tacos don't come in these pre-shapen, dried out, hard shells like some other places. You can see some of the grease on it form the very recent deep-frying, and it is perfectly crisp without being dried out. The meet is always cooked perfectly. I have never ordered something and been disappointed by dried out meat. Some of my favorite things here are the chimichanga and hard-shell beef tacos, which is shredded beef, not the crappy ground junk that a lot of places use. The Chimichangas have to be my favorite, though. I have never had a chimichanga this great. Be careful, though, because the inside of it is REALLY HOT. You will burn yourself if you don't let it cool a little. I would love to talk about the taste of the food more, but I'm making myself too hungry, so I'll move on.  The best part about Carolina's is the price. You cannot beat the price for the quality of food you get. Tacos are all $0.75, all the time! I guarantee you will be filled up from tacos before you feel like you spent too much on them, and you won't be disappointed with the taste! I can't remember the exact price for the chimichangas, but I do remember that it is much less than you will pay anywhere else, and much more delicious!  The location isn't the best, but who cares. The best stuff is always hard to find! If you don't think it's in a safe area and that is what's deterring you, don't let it. There are cops in and out of there all the time to eat. Plus, nobody wants to pull any crap here because it's just too good!  EDIT: Tacos are not $0.75 anymore. I guess they are up to $2.00 now. New price is disappointing, but this doesn't change my rating because they are still the best tacos around!|review|QQQ78Yom7_8m4jjWCPG6Cw|0|0|1

I cannot believe that I would find myself saying there are better places than Bianco and Cibo in town when it comes to getting a good pizza.  I visit this place regularly for lunch or dinner and they never disappoint.  When it comes to why this place is amazing I will say it's the DETAIL.  They have a very good design inside, just awesome use of an old bank and the remodel is just amazing.  Finally the food needs to be just as good!   They have a starter plate option that consists of choosing your favorite seasonal selections of cheese and meats.  I have to say I was super bummed when they switched things up from Spring but the new selections have been great.  They have great vegetarian options but their strengths are in the homemade pasta and their meats.  I have had the Ribs on a weekly special and they just melted in my mouth.  They have some variations of specials throughout the week where they try to create themes and I have been blown away by their approaches to different dishes.    Then there is the pizza, again my favorite thin Neapolitan style that can be found more and more in Phoenix.  I have always commended Pizzeria Bianco and Cibo near town but now the Parlour is right there with them. Bravo!|review|giwch_jkHmILclbawH3FSg|1|0|1

DiDZqjm_ti1Kim-5BhHPfA|2013-09-27|-F-AfxXmLaY0mHRLJ77xmQ|5|If you're a wine fan in the mood to try something new but don't know where to start, head to Wine Warehouse of Scottsdale in north Scottsdale.  The store/bar opened this month and features dozens of wines and craft beers for any price range and taste.  What's coolest about the spot: lounging at the bar is an awesome place where you can sample wine before you throw down to purchase, and the vibe is friendly and relaxing, unlike what you might find if you just go to Trader Joe's.  I went there this week with some friends to try some of their selections, a variety of red and white wine, including a carbonated red called Bellina that tasted so awesome, just like cherry Coke, I took a bottle home with me. At $8.99, it was a steal and a must-try!  Monday's through Friday's, the Warehouse hosts a happy hour, with $9 wine flights, $2 off wines by the glass, and $3 of create-your-own six-packs of beer.  The coolest deal, though, is that you're always able to create your own 12-pack of wine bottles for only $60 from what's available at that price point. Like our hosts pointed out, the case would make a great set of holiday presents, with quality selections at only $5 a pop -- what a steal!  The bar is also offering up periodic wine tastings, including one Saturday, September 28, from 5-7 p.m., which will include free cheese plates and wine samples. I had some of the Warehouse's cheese and fruit when I went, and it was delicious.  Besides my favorite wine, the Bellafina from Italy, we also tried the Lo Nuevo, a refreshing Spanish white wine; the Viognier, a clean and acidic wine from Northern California; the Drops of Jupiter, a red wine from San Francisco that is actually made by Train guitarist Jimmy Stafford; the robust Mercer Cabernet Sauvignon from Washington; and the smooth Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon from Wente Vineyards.  I thought they were all great choices to sample, and I liked all of them. I'm usually not a white wine drinker, but I enjoyed the ones I sampled, especially Lo Nuevo from my dad's home country.  Wine Warehouse has plans to open a patio with TVs, and I think it'd be a fun yet practical place to visit if you want to have a glass of wine and save money by drinking a bottle at home. It's not as formal as some wine bars, which can be great for happy hour, and the store's atmosphere, with fun ceiling hangings such as a cupcake, give it a welcoming feel.

When we told them our party WAS indeed all present, but just in the bathroom, they took another ten minutes to get us taken care of.  Then they scoffed when we asked where our waiter went fifteen minutes after taking our drink order.  The wait staff themselves are usually decent, to be honest.  But it's a little inconsistent.  If cheapness is your thing, come here.  After all, it's run by the wizards who brought you the authentic stylings of Chili's and On the Border (oh, sorry, most of the ladder here in Phoenix closed).  You can get a run-of-the-mill pasta and one to take home for $12.95.  I do enjoy the late night fridge raid of my second meal, but it's nothing I couldn't have spent ten minutes and made in my own pot.  The classics menu is a who's who of boring concoctions with no original take on them.  The atmosphere here is interesting and surprisingly void of a North Scottsdale vibe.  Problem is you never know exactly what you're going to get.  I'm not a huge fan of any chain Italian, but I'll take Carrabba's across the street; feels a bit more warm to me even if it's less hip, and the menu offers more excitement.|review|IIed4GFtBNbn7HWPy-4VLg|0|0|1

OK, it was two pairs but who's counting?  However, when I tried to repeat that lucky find on another visit, things went downhill fast.  After wandering through and finding nothing worth even trying on, I headed out the door at the same time that a man (who I think works there) with a large box was coming in.  The security alarm went off, but since I didn't touch/linger over/try on/purchase anything I paused briefly then just kept walking.  Mistake.  The woman behind the counter ran out of the store yelling ""you need to come back in here RIGHT NOW!"".  Ummm... people are staring... I go back inside with her, and she gives me a kind of up-down look and says she has to see the inside of my purse.  I can't hold it open and let her see, she has to take it from me and paw through it on the counter.  Really?  You think I took something?  The outfit I am wearing (grown-up business clothes, by the way) is fitted and does not have pockets and the purse (not one of my usual suitcase-sized bags) is very small.  Where, exactly, did she think I was hiding merchandise?  Did I somehow fit a pair of stilettos in my bra?  WTF!?  Finding nothing, she proceeds to lecture me on the importance of removing the magnetic security tags from inside clothing since they set off her alarm.  Um, I don't have any of those but gee, thanks for the helpful information.  Hmmm... do you think maybe the guy coming in with the box set off your alarm and not me?    There are plenty of other places to feed my footwear habit without being completely embarrassed."|review|n9Zg0jlOGtxfIrvoPm6Hhw|6|3|11

Wife plays tennis and with the new facility we decided to give it a whirl again.  The Cons:  * The weight room is pretty weak in terms of equipment and layout. Enough to get a good workout in, but only if there are less than say 10-15 others using it.  * The weight room is only separated from the basketball courts by a 7' high wall and balls do come flying over.  * Pretty rude/snobby members. Most will walk right by you in a hallway, have eye contact, then look down and keep walking. Basic politeness is at least a small smile or hi. Seems the members here think pretty highly of themselves, never encountered that at other gyms.  * Kid's, I think the yuppie parents think this is free daycare and just drop off their kids here for 4 hours of running around screaming and chasing each other.   The Pro's:  * The facility is very nice and well kept. They always have workers cleaning and what not. I give them the most prop's for that.  * Nice location, out of the hustle and bustle of the airpark.  * The tennis center is great. My wife loves playing here and they have great clinics. She is very happy, that's good.  * The café, this is most likely the best place to get food up in this area. We eat there quite often. The service is always good, and helpful with special requests for your diet.    Nice place, but the members should try and be more polite. Seems like this is the biggest issue with us. Just amazed at the attitudes.|review|jeGU96alywG5iHWuj4Fazg|0|0|0

The restaurant was not at 40% capacity at this time so there seeemed to be no reason for the wait. Our group ate the prime rib sandwich: yum, the penne with lemon sauce: yum. The Cobb salad came out with nothing but lettuce and it took us a while to fine our waiter to get the remaining ingredients. He quickly fixed it and apologized. It was actually very funny that we were brought out just lettuce! We also ordered to pad Thai. Which was ok. The flatbreads were a hit though!  The drinks were good and the location was good for us.

Their service is very good and they offer a different special each day.  You can't go wrong with their pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw on top.  They BBQ pork the way it should be, slow and low and with out the sauce until your ready to eat it.  It's probably the best thing on their menu! They have good fries and the other sides are average at best.  My son loves their mac~cheese but it's too dried out and over cooked if your eating dinner, so come to eat their mac~cheese for lunch!   I found their beef brisket and ribs to be over cooked if you can imagine that... (how can you over cook ribs?) I've ordered them a couple of different times and found them to be a little dry and chewy.  My son also loves their chicken fingers, but what kid doesn't?     They have different types of BBQ sauce for you to choose from based on your pallet's desire of sweetness, tang-y-ness or ready for some heat.  Next time your near Norterra and looking for BBQ that's quick and cheap, this is a good place to go.  Have a pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw on top, use their hot BBQ sauce, side of fries and a sweet iced tea!|review|YLE6GoJ61fb0QBF7JTkaJg|5|3|5

One review said most of the beers are North American, which seems they don't know beer. EXTENSIVE beer list and the only place I've found with Chimay.  The food is expensive but so worth it. The mac & cheese is amazing and their onion rings are among the best I've ever had.  If you're into seafood, you MUST try their crab crusted swordfish with wasabi mashed potatoes. Again, the only place I've found that serves swordfish.  They are really busy because of their location so I would recommend reservations.  It's the best meal you'll find at Westgate.

It was a great trip to Old Town Scottsdale, and I was pleasantly surprised by the experience.  I am now living in DC, and bought a Groupon to SVW to have an outing with the family. So, my parents and I made the trek from Chandler to Scottsdale to attend our first ever wine tasting. I was expecting stuffy Scottsdale owners and servers who would talk down to us due to our ignorance in all things wine related. This is was not the case is the slightest. We were greeted very warmly and asked to be seated at the bar. After telling our server that we did not know a thing about wine, she patiently explained how the menu worked, how our Groupon was to be used, and what wines she believed we would enjoy the most. Boy was she dead on! As much as I would love to say that I enjoy a full-bodied Sryah, I am more of a fruity/fizzy kind of girl, and opted for the lighter selections. My father, who is a whiskey/brandy/scotch drinker, did the same while mom my opted to be the DD.   The entire experience was delightful. Between the three of us, we order two apps (cheese plate & antipasto) and my dad and I samples 5 different wines. Surprisingly, all of the wines are grown locally, and are VERY VERY GOOD.   I highly recommend trying SVW. The staff are great, the service is impeccable, and the  ambiance is inviting. I visited in the late afternoon, but overheard the staff talking about their very busy evening ahead. I suggest make a reservation if you are planning to go at night.|review|c7AyEUnJewJoV1Kdx5bm6g|0|0|1

Although not very diverse in the makeup of the crowd (we were the only Latinos in the place), it had a great vibe and a very friendly atmosphere. The bartenders were awesome and the drinks were great! Angel, the female bartender, was as sweet as can be and chatted with us for a few minutes. She actually grew up in the Bay Area (where I currently live), so it was nice to talk to someone from the area. LOVED HER. Chris, the male bartender, was also very friendly and kept checking with us to make sure we were doing alright. The DJ was playing a mix of Old School Funk with a little R&B, which was great for the relaxed atmosphere. The bar area has cameras showing what's going on on the dance floor in the other room, which was kind of interesting. All in all, we had a great time.

I asked if she could check if other locations have it on stock and voila!, the Kierland branch had two and Carla (name?) would hold one of them for me.  By the time I'd arrived to buy the bag here, the store had closed early to prepare for a private viewing later on in the evening, but Carla (or the manager that evening) let me in, gave me the bag for inspection, and even extended an invitation for me to grab a couple of See's truffles from one of the stations of truffles and petit fours on display for the night's guests and a bottle of water (as is customary when shopping at Brighton's) as she finalized the sale.

I visit this trail a handful of times each year... usually when I have company in town that is interested in hiking.    Cholla is the ""easier"" of the trails you can hike on Camelback Mountain.  Echo Canyon is a lot more intense.  Even so, you'll get a workout on either side...   I'm always sore after I hike Cholla since I do it so infrequently.  I highly recommend doing an early morning sunrise hike... and regardless of what time of day you go, pack some water and wear your sunscreen.

Started with the pastry plate, which today was slices of scones: Chocolate Chip, Raspberry, and Raisin. IMO they were a little dense, almost a scone cookie - but still tasty.   The BLD Iced Coffee was different. A blend of Irish Creme and French Vanilla coffees it was a bit too sweet for my palate, but my wife thought it was spot on.  My wife had the Short Rib Benedict with Fingerling/Shallot potatoes. She really enjoyed the entire entree and was reluctant to share with me. I prevailed and have to add my agreement, a very good dish!  I went a little more standard. Biscuits and Sausage gravy with Scrambled eggs and Chorizo potatoes. It was wonderful! Fluffy biscuits, tasty Sausage Gravy, eggs dry but not rubbery, nice chunks of red potatoes mixed with a good chorizo... remembering is making me hungry!  I thought the food was excellent. Impressive for an opening week. The service was warm and friendly, although our server had to return to the kitchen several times to fill in knowledge gaps.

I have been there times when there are dirty tables, but when the line of people ordering never stops you have to go easy on them.   Either  way the food is worth the wait. The machaca tacos are my favorite along with the standard bean and cheese burritos. I love that you can load up on as much salsa as you want.  The breakfast burritos are great (try the four way: egg, potato, bean, cheese).   It is cheap and fast (even with said lines) and the tortillas rock.

Very soggy.).  Nice friendly greeting at the door, and I was seated right away.  (Sad to see TFK's business was much slower than that of ZB's.)  Ordered my favorite, the onion tart, but I also wanted to try something new- the Columbia River steelhead salmon, which the menu promised it comes with shiso (red or green leafy greens), lime, avocado (hold the avo, please!), and cilanto aioli.  It is served on the bread made in-house.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate muffin/cake w/ organic butter ice cream, organic chocolate sauce, and cocoa nibs (!).  The salmon sandwich was excellent!!  Everything that comprised this sandwich was fabulous, from the whole-grain and veggie bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slathered on it, to the oh-so-moist medium-rare salmon, tomato, and the not-so-usual leafy topping, shiso.  It took all my willpower to not eat the entire thing!  I wish I could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash...  The kale was so tough to chew.  However, chewing wouldn't have been such a task if the kale wasn't also very dry!  My salad was pretty rough, so I abandoned it right away.  [I know that kale is SO VERY good for me, but sometimes what's good for my health isn't so great for my digestive system :( ]  I wasn't a fan of their hash in the past, and tonight's side dish didn't win me over, either.  I won't give it another chance.  Another disappointment was the onion tart.  First, the presentation left me wondering who took a chunk off my plate and ate it?  No, this was just how it was assembled and baked, I was told.  Variances, he said.  The exquisite crunch I so loved in this pizza was gone, and so was the flavor.  Very bland.  Another menu item I must cross of my list :(   Oh, but the dessert!!  Very moist cake, which sat on silky, rich organic dark chocolate sauce, with lovely (!) crushed cocoa nibs- loved that crunch!  I think I surprised my server by guessing correctly what those nibs were!  (I've had them before in trail snack bags from Whole Foods.)  The best part?  Why, the homemade butter ice cream!  I need to go back and have another scoop (or two!) very soon...  Excellent service- very informative.  Kudos to my server who never showed impatience after having to answer all of my questions- some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few times, too!  Thank you very much!|review|0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ|5|2|7
3wLLf8wRqD1ZQowi9aZSoA|2012-04-08|VjCPgR6wDvftFIxHtmzjWA|5|"This restaurant has multiple seating options: bar seating in the center of the room with tv's nestled above, mafioso booths on the right-hand side, tables on the left, as well as outdoor seating under a shaded pergola. It was scarcely occupied today but on Easter that could be a hit or miss. We opted for a booth and I was pleasantly surprised that this decor was slightly country....but not down-home Southern country. It had that ""farm"" element to it, but not more like farm-chic, or as my husband called it  ""neuvo-farmish"". It's clearly a design term..... I ordered an iced tea which was filled repeatedly, along with our waters. In fact, when my husbands water no longer had ice in it we were brought a glass of ice. Damn, they're good. We both ordered fish sandwiches. His: the blackened fish sandwich with remoulade, red onion, butter lettuce on an artisan bun. Mine: rare ahi tuna with siracha mayo with the same bun an accoutrements. I love that you can order a different side off their ""farm"" menu rather than just getting fries. I opted for the jumbo roasted asparagus which put me at awe first at their gorgeous appearance, and secondly, their crispy-juicy texture. My husbands jalapeno-cheddar grits were quite tasty as well. No really spicy, which would have been nice, but had a great flavor with the jalapenos. I thought both sandwiches were good, although my piece of tuna was an odd cut and a little too soft. I like when ahi has that great fresh-firmness to it and when they cut it so you don't have to navigate around a piece of fascia...cause' that's no fun.  If I wasn't so full I would've made my husband split the key lime pie, which I'm always a sucker for. Perhaps next time.

ojjtPlnSmCX1zCzWL7JoNQ|2007-11-28|w-Nt0lByhghIOjrS2AvY5A|5|Panera Bread.   That's what I thought of when I first walked in. Wildflower is to Phoenix as Panera is to Oklahoma City, where I used to live. Yet, I wasn't quite accurate with that. You see, Wildflower goes above and beyond your typical bread company/eatery. Sure, places like Panera are great but Wildflower is in a league of its own.   Lucky for me, I knew what I wanted right away, which is unusual when I first encounter a new, exciting array of options. I chose their chicken basil chili and 1/2 their roast beef & Gorgonzola sandwich. Both were perfect - really. The chili was festive without being overly filling, for the 1/2 sandwich was a generous portion of sourdough bread, fresh tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, peppers (so good!) and Gorgonzola cheese. Plus, their herb mayo was an added touch I could enjoy (and I usually hate mayo).   My lunch companion ordered their black bean soup with a 1/2 turkey breast and brie sandwich. It looked equally perfect, with huge slices of brie satisfying my cheese-lovin' friend.   Plus, the price for this pairing was reasonable - just under $8.   My friend got a pretzel for us to share. It was definitely good, not to mention one of the biggest pretzels I've ever seen!   In fact, I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this place. When you walk in, you immediately see their vast selection of breads and sweets. Their menu is also diverse with a variety of options. You could probably eat here every day of the week and find something new and delightful with each experience.   I say experience because that's about what it is. You order your food at the register and get a table marker to place on your table. Shortly after, your meal comes hot and lookin' divine - really. While this is a get-your-own-beverage place, you can enjoy some of the perks of being waited on, like your food being delivered with clean silverware, as well as your plate being cleared when you finish. I like that alot. Then you can enjoy a few moments post-meal to chat with your comrad(s).  In the middle of the restaurant is this over-sized beautiful light (chandelier style) that looks like roots sprouting flowers. It's something, alright. I made the comment that I'd have that in my house, if I owned one - a house, that is.. Sure, that may be a bit over-the-top, but it's indicative of how I felt while dining here for lunch. Granted, I give my companion some credit, for I always enjoy her company. Also, she's the one who suggested we eat here. For that, I owe her - perhaps I'll spring for lunch next time (great excuse to make a return visit).   GOOD NEWS! I think I found my new favorite place to dine when I'm craving soup, a gourmet sandwich or fresh salad.   They also serve breakfast, have a kids section of the menu and whip up some fantastic cafe beverages, including ones that tempted me: the roasted honey cappuccino and the peppermint hot cocoa.   I definitely need to make a repeat visit, try their different breads and indulge in their breakfast menu, which is served until 2 p.m. on weekends. I mean, c'mon, can you really resist the roasted tomato feta & egg sandwich or the lemon ricotta pancakes? I didn't think so.|review|APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA|3|1|4

May have been the company I was with, or perhaps the oppressive July heat, but you more than redeemed yourself this time.  Had the beet salad and salmon & cucumber sandwich. That's not a typo. I don't think I've ever eaten salmon with cucumber either knowing or intentionally. But dammit, that's one tasty sandwich. [EDIT: a friend pointed out that given the amount of sushi I've consumed in my life, I almost certainly have had salmon and cucumber before. my bad]  Next up is the beer selection which, while not as exhaustive as the Lost Leaf two blocks down, is quality. Chimay on draft. 'Nuff said.  Moving on to the Nutella croissant. Whichever evil genius in the kitchen dreamed this concoction up should be damn proud of themselves. It was warm melty chocolate heaven.  Also, waitstaff was pleasant and attentive, and the local art on the walls is bad ass. So yeah, you should eat here.|review|o9qVoftkxrFwC6W5PImouw|2|1|5

I also enjoyed the view at the back of the restaurant where you could see the kitchen.    I found the food delicious.  The bread was indeed a treat.  I went with the BLT salad and added wood-fired chicken.  The dressing was to die for! They didn't smother it and everything tasted extremely fresh.  The portion was a bit large though and I ended up bringing a lot home.  My boyfriend had their burger and found the bacon to be supremely seasoned and the perfect texture.   He is a burger lover and this one it near the top of his list.  Would love to return and try other meals here.|review|1jt7K-_2bXxEdNa5s7fiXA|0|0|1
Uke8Pq1m918WW0n0_jEmWw|2011-03-24|A1KHjher74mWqT5bBaqeMg|4|I went here yesterday for lunch during the lunch rush.  If my wife wasn't with me I would have left because the line was too long for me and I hate waiting.  Anyway, she wanted to eat here so I had to suck it up.  To my eye this place is a combination of Sauce and Paradise Cafe.  It is not a bad thing because they definitely put their own spin on things.  The menu is simple and doesn't overwhelm you with options.  The prices are a bit high but you do get some quality stuff so I guess it is ok.  Aside from the line and the clusterfuq of an ordering/pickup process, this place is actually pretty solid.  The salads and sandwiches are fresh, unique, customizable, tasty and awesome.  I had a small Caesar and 1/2 of an AZ tri-tip sandwich.  The Caesar was just ok but my sandwich was great.  I love how they grill the meat right there in front of you.  My wife got some fru fru salad which she loved.  I just moved into the area so I can't wait to return to try more of their soups/salads/sandwiches and pizzas.|review|rLtl8ZkDX5vH5nAx9C3q5Q|0|0|0

Whenever I've gone through, they've messed up my order, have given me lip, and in general it feels like they try to place the blame on me for my order being wrong. This place is rude, they can't get the orders right, and worst of all, they do not take allergens into account. We specified we wanted plain cream cheese because my girlfriend has a tree nut allergy, so instead of that they gave us herb and garlic. What that tells me is that they do not value their customers, nor the information given to them.  TL;DR: It was NOT a great day at Dunkin.|review|1fZrSKqNbXdwyvtAlcbtTQ|0|0|0

I find that hooters centered around campuses have less service then others.. and this locay is no exception. This place is also kinda interesting. They have tables but really low seats and some tables with high stools. The restaurant feels hodge podge in the back.. so opt for a table in the front.  Go for the wings and to watch some games.

Well, he's Chinese (kinda - haha) and recommended this restaurant because he grew-up coming here with his parents.    We ordered some dumplings, which they steamed for us, a spicy pork chop dish and then I ordered my favorite which wasn't on the menu, sauteed fish filet in black bean sauce.

I knew about this place before, but didn't check it out until I purchased a deal on living social. And I am so glad I did!   Went in for the first time last week. They had two flavors of vegan gelato, six flavors of sorbet (which is also non dairy) and I think they had one or two flavors of vegan soft serve, among other dairy based flavors of gelato and soft serve. I opted for both flavors of the vegan gelato. The guy working the counter was really nice. He told us they rotate the flavors about once a month, so they always have something different. The flavors I got this day were pistachio and amaretto chocolate. Both were really good. And I have had REAL gelato before. Like the kind in Italy. And these were just as good. I wont say better because nothing beats Italian gelato, but these were definitely the best vegan gelato I have ever had. I went back a couple of days later and they had a third flavor of gelato out, spicy chocolate. It was definitely spicy. There is no way I could ever eat an entire cup of it. But it was good for a couple bites. I am excited to go back in a few weeks to see what new flavors they have.|review|2nXFEyQ06RfcdAXIPbxuwA|0|0|1

I like fat on my meat, but not to the point where there's so little meat that all I'm chewing and swallowing is fat.  It was very unpleasant.  The cornbread muffin was not moist at all and landed on the table from the server's hands with a rock-like thud.   I've had better macaroni salad at AJ's.  There was not one redeeming quality to the meal.  My friends' pork sandwiches were tasteless also, with semi-cold buns and touch/chewy meat.

I'm not kidding, actual tortillas. Not rice paper, or won ton wrappers. Tortillas. And as I opened up the box with the actual veggies in it, it compleatly broke and smashed all over my carpet.  Moving on. The quality of the chicken was the worst. My first bite was filled with fat and the veggies wern't even cooked. (Huge pieces of raw pepper and onion).

My boyfriend and I went to Star of India for dinner.  I got the chicken tikka masala, while he got the channa masala.  My chicken tikka masala was absolutely perfect, all buttery, with tender chicken and a spiciness that was tasty and not overwhelming.  His channa masala was really good -- he asked for medium spiciness and it was considerably spicier than my mild.   We ordered a parantha and a naan to go with our entrees. When the very nice owner asked us how our meal was, my boyfriend offhandedly said the parantha was a little different from what he was used to, that it's not as fluffy and tender as parantha from other cultures.  The owner immediately set out to find us a bread we would like, giving us a free order of roti, and free order of rice to pack with my to-go box for my chicken tikka masala.    The owner was gracious and eager to please, and really fun to chat with.  That made all the difference, and with the great food, we'll definitely be going back!    p.s. get the gulab jamun -- it's delicious!|review|sEURxOp8LQNM_lZ7IlEmUQ|0|0|0

This is a great way to visit downtown or take people who are in from out of town.  The Bad -  The tour did run a little long, I think it to took an hour before we actually left to go to our first stop, that could have been shortened.  The real trouble I had was actually getting the tour booked.  I had purchased a Groupon and tried booking prior to it expiring, I called to make the reservation but all of the dates were full, I asked if my Groupon could be extended because of this and I was told (by a man) no, and that next time I should ""be a little more proactive."" This was 2 weeks out before the expiration date, so it seemed like more had been sold than could be handled.  I really tried working with him, offering to just use two of my Groupons instead of all 4 and being flexible with any day or time, but his attitude was just really bad.  I had actually forgotten about this until I was going though my Groupons, I was able to use them for the price I paid, but it sucks to purchase 4 tickets to something and not be able to use them.  Jessica was very nice on the phone, she did give us the drink upgrade with out charging us and honestly I think if it had not been for her I probably would have called Groupon and asked for my money back."|review|em76U1mmXJw-ZuLYYLVUDA|1|0|1

Chips and salsa were quick to arrive and the salsa is really amazing! Our waitress took our drink orders and was surprised when she said I couldn't have sugar around the rim of my margarita glass. Hmm...never encountered that one before. Margaritas were delicious though and only $4! We each had 2, they were kinda small. For dinner, I ordered chicken fajitas and my boyfriend ordered a burro with rice and beans. Our food came pretty quick and was really delicious!

Since my hubby and his parents came with me for restaurant week, we could choose the scallops, meatloaf, or ""smart chicken is cool"" for our prix fix menu entrees. Upon my first visit here for a friend's birthday, I thought ""Really? They actually named a dish ""Smart Chicken is Cool""?"" I tried it anyway inspite of the title, and I'm glad I did, because the chicken was tender and really tasty unexpectedly. What was even better was the risotto that came with the chicken with truffle oil. I melt for truffles/truffle oil infused food!  The pork belly pastrami as promised did not disappoint! That disappeared very quickly among four people. Perhaps we should've ordered more? The Im-port mixed drink was very unique in flavor and almost sweet - reminiscent of a dessert port. I liked it better than the Sazerac, which was a little bit potent for my taste. Although I might've enjoyed it more if I didn't have the Im-port first. Our waiter was good and checked on us often, except when we wanted bread and he forgot to bring it to us. I'll let it slide though, because he was so good otherwise and brought us tons of other ""yummy"" food and drinks quickly after we placed the order and I applaud him for that on such a busy night (the end of restaurant week this past Sunday)."|review|HR_Lxh2ycv0t745Ohiziew|1|0|3

We were in town for Spring Training, and while Adam and I are pretty open to trying new places, my aunt and uncle are less inclined. So we found somewhere (thanks, Yelpers) that seemed to have a pretty solid selection of Mexican food. And that's what we found.  The food is in no way mind-blowing, but it's different enough that you don't find everything on the menu at a standard chain Mexican place. Our drinks were tasty, and they have a pretty wide selection of cocktails and beer to keep the crowd happy.   The ambiance is nice - even though it was pretty crowded, we were seated fairly quickly on the patio, and we didn't have to shout to have a conversation. Our service, though, was pretty mediocre, and we had to flag down our waiter several times because he would not regularly check on us.

I have never brought someone there and had them not like it.   The atmosphere is great - small and cozy, and very warmly decorated for a former post office.  The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts, and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar.   Service is typically good unless they are super busy (Friday and Saturday).  In addition to the wine choices, the bruschetta is awesome!  My favorite is the red pepper goat cheese, but I've also heard very good things about the proscuitto/mascarpone/fig one.  You order a sampler of four different types at a time - and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat options.  The only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the SE Valley - it is a far drive from Chandler or Gilbert to the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix.  Here's a tip though: when you get there, don't wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot, there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby.|review|n2I2GQuL1R26DlV-WWDRAA|0|0|1

WFDxa8r0sT2ZnehYTyT1LQ|2013-06-26|Z8GtpfcwOMY7AEnQvrd8ig|5|Beautiful resort close enough to Phoenix that it doesn't take forever to get there, but when I arrived, I definitely felt like I was on vacation!  I went for a weekend to escape Phoenix and enjoy some pampering, and loved it! Starting with a nice lunch at the Boulders Café: I had the burger with cheese and grilled onions. It comes on a toasted brioche bun and is INCREDIBLE. The fries are tiny shoestrings, which were kind of a surprise, but in a good way. My dining companion had the Asian chicken salad, that was just the right size for lunch and was dressed in a nice spicy peanut vinaigrette.   The casita was spacious and very comfortable. You can watch a big flat screen TV from the comfy leather chairs, or enjoy a real wood fire in the fireplace (remember that you are in the dry desert and there are burning restrictions in the summer). The king bed was incredibly luxurious. In fact, it drew in me in for a little longer than I was supposed to sleep, but I loved it!   I also found the shower and bathtub to be roomy and high end. The toilet is tucked away in the bathroom with it's own pocket door for extra privacy and comfort. The double sinks and large counter offered more than enough space for two people to get ready at the same time.  The walk-in closet was massive for a hotel room, and had built-in drawers, bathrobe hooks, and a shelf all the way around for shoes and hats. There is also a fireproof safe and an extra pillow and blanket in the closet if you need that. Connecting the closet to the bathroom is a lighted vanity, complete with a little drawer and stool.    The Boulders provides a robe and slippers for each guest, as well as a complimentary bottle of water for each guest, and one lighted key chain per room, which I found to be over-the-top nice.   Don't forget to brew your own coffee or tea using the in-room Keurig maker, then step out on to the patio and enjoy the morning (or evening) view of the awesome surroundings.   The grounds are massive, with paved trails, so any time you need to go somewhere, just dial the front desk and request a cart pickup. Every single cart driver that I encountered was pleasant and professional. In fact every staff member I encountered seemed happy to be there and even more eager to ensure I was having a good time and had everything I needed.  In all, The Boulders is well worth the price of admission. Locals get a special rate, so if you can produce an AZ ID at check-in, be sure to request that rate when making the reservation. I will certainly be back to this resort!|review|s8laFXnj46f_1GAleJ16nw|0|0|0

The decor could use some sprucing up but over all it's neat and clean. The service is excellent. The staff is very attentive. Always willing to bring you another plate of wonderful bruschetta (and it's free!).   If you go an a weekend in the evening you get to hear the sounds of Buddy Raymond. His tunes add to the ambiance. He is very entertaining. My family has actually become fans of Buddy and look forward to his oldies. We only visit Portofino on nights that he will be in attendance.

Ask for lemon with water, why they don't already know that their water tastes like chlorine is beyond me.  Favs: The burger is 10oz of quality beef.  Calamari appetizer.  Not thrilled: Po' Boy Shrimp sandwich is overwrought with the taste of onion.  Cheesy Corn Dogs I think might have been better without the cheese oddly enough.  Green Chilie Stew was amazingly salty.  Enh: Baked Onion Soup - could have been better if it weren't $8 for 6oz.  Good selection of beer on tap.    More than likely I will be back, my family really dig the burger.  I still have a desire to try so many other things but I'm night acquiesce and just stick with the burger.  And tater tots.|review|PVbcpvrSKv2GTBK9QiQgiA|2|1|2

My wife and I went here for lunch last week. We felt like we were eating at a friends house instead of at a restaurant.  Chris, the owner and chef, is a great cook, improvises magically and is very personable.  Instead of ordering from a menu, we were told by Chris what he had available in the kitchen...and he then offered options on how he could prepare to our tastes.  How great is that.  I started with a strong cup of coffee...Chris serves Cafe Du Monde...which is primo coffee which speaks to the coffee enthusiast.  My wife and I split a great French onions soup....which was great if you like onions!  I followed with a chicken sandwich with roasted peppers, goat cheese, spinach and cilantro. My wife had a chicken sandwich as well with bacon, fig, spinach and mint.  Both sandwiches were amazing and innovative.  We took notes on how to make to repeat when we got home!  However, the best part of Cafe Monarch is Chris...a great chef and business owner.  He cares about his guests, what they eat and sincerely wants you to have a great experience....and we did.   We'd go back again...and if I'm back in Scottsdale for business...I will!|review|YD2trEiFhj_ehUNCpFtfsA|1|0|2

It seemed like they had maybe 3 people working, and we'd often wait (what felt like) 15 minutes to get any attention, even when I was just standing there waiting to be seated (or greeted, for that matter).  The menu is fairly comprehensive. The food is decent. I wasn't amazingly impressed, but I wasn't disappointed, either. Some of the prices seem steep. The atmosphere is kind of cramped and congested, but it was comfortable. Slightly loud, but you could still hear each other talk.  But considering that I lost my dinner after I got home, I'm okay with not going back. No huge loss here.|review|cq2Vu3g1auTQ4nlNOVjegA|1|1|2

In fact, they don't serve any food.  This might be the only place that is a BYOF (food).  We had pizza from the outside delivered once.  At the minimum, they will have a food truck hovering near the entrance.  Order it and bring it inside or sometimes the truck people will just bring it to you.

n_HvrTuGUgxXJM0yq39-0g|2012-03-29|6J9AcZFQTm8JVO8K7ydF0g|3|So my dad, mom and I decided to order pizza tonight from a place other than Hungry Howies or Dominoes. We looked at NYPD, Barro's and Streets of New York until we finally settled on Chizona's since it's a few streets up from my house. We called in and ordered two pizzas, one cheese with feta and the other pepperoni and sausage, hot wings and breaded zucchini. It only took about 45 minutes to get to us and when it arrived it was super fresh and hot. That's always a plus. The pizza smelled divine so we sat down to eat and the first thing we noticed was the crust. Maybe we have been spoiled by all the non authentic pizza we have been ordering over the years, but the crust was slightly flavorless and borderline too crunchy to even eat. The sauce and the toppings were awesome, though, and the breaded zucchini was great! I can't speak on the wings personally but my dad ate a few and commented that they were good. One really big plus was that  nothing was overly greasy and it was probably the freshest pizza I've ever had delivered to me.  All in all I'm not ranting and raving about Chizona's,  but I'm not writing them off either.|review|NDmtjLBVvT4ICo4vRpe9Pw|0|0|0

Food was good, the shrimp tacos were about a 4, but we were disappointed, or rather spoiled with the shrimp cocktails. The juice was kinda watered down, not a whole lot of flavor, unless you add Tapatio and the free chip salsa to it. We were used to shrimp cocktails from south of the border, so we had a higher expectation. No big deal, we loved the food, the service, and the location.|review|vAWAJhMe3nHXSTQew3N4wA|0|0|0

To charge my tablet I had to go in a little tiny corner where I spotted a an outlet. There were other outlets on the floor, but they were all taken up. Even worse, there were other people standing around until it was available.  Overall, the feel of the airport was outdated and definitely needed more outlets!|review|4cKYG2JG7J0c1Ws8gIK6xg|0|0|0

This is the ultimate neighborhood bar experience because nearly every dude that entered during my two-hour stay was greeted by name. I had read about happy Hour specials online prior, but when I asked about them to the heavily tattooed bargirl, she didn't mention them, instead telling me about the higher priced all-day special. How can you get new regulars if you treat the newcomers like we are from Planet Mar?  Maybe they got enough regulars, but they might need to get younger cause some of regulars are getting old. She did become nicer after I chatted up one of her old buddies at the bar and she even put the Yankees game on the small bar TV for me. The food I ordered to go contained the worst version of sweet potato fries ever - burnt and undercooked at the same time (see photo). The Western Chicken was pretty good though featuring two giant onion rings and a rather large thin cut chicken breast covered with cheese and bonus bacon which wasn't on the original description. The bun took a beating with too much BBQ sauce, but overall not bad. It is supposed to get crowded at night, might check it out then and happy Hour prices are good on domestics also.|review|DrWLhrK8WMZf7Jb-Oqc7ww|0|0|1

The last time I was out here was about 10 years ago for some Top Fuel Hydro races and honestly, not a lot has changed (except for pricing lol).  Also I think every ticket is eligible for pit area access now. Years ago you had to purchase a pit pass if you wanted to check that section out. If you do decide to visit the pit area be sure to stand behind a Dragster or Funny Car when they start it up. Its one of the coolest things you'll ever experience although its not recommended for the faint of heart. Once that NitroMethane fills the air around you your eyes, nose and throat immediately start to burn. It wears off pretty fast but its funny to see everyone running towards fresh air while coughing ( I won't lie, I was one of them).  My overall experience was amazing although its probably better to go during the February races, due to the fact that its still pretty hot out there in October.  Be sure to bring enough cash because everything is pretty pricey but thats to be expected. I think a large beer was about $9.50. GEEZUS!!! Oh and also plan on spending a good half hour trying to get out of there after the races. If you're not in a hurry to leave try to stick around because traffic is a nightmare right after the final race. You can waste some time by going down on the track, which, by the way is really, really sticky (one of my shoes almost fused to the track :D). Or you can buy some discounted food and drink but its definitely not a good idea to leave right away.|review|6uiCxbxpNSt1bWYT2xwAsA|1|1|0

In my case it was a gargantuan bowl of the steak pho with marvelous amounts of jalapeños, bean sprouts, and noodles. It was good by itself but of course I added unreasonable quantities of their house made chili sauce ...and it hurt so good.   My husband opted for the chicken pad thai and it was good as well, albeit a little too sweet for my taste. It was a little pricey for the quantity but worth it for the authenticity. We got the two entrees and a couple of Tsing Taos and our bill came to about $26. We all know that pho doesn't keep well so unfortunately I had to decline taking my leftovers home.    While the food was good, I can't give this place more than a 3-star because the restaurant was a little grungy and the service left something to be desired...I never did get the thai tea I ordered.

The staff was friendly enough but overall this place isn't memorable. I wouldn't drive out of my way to visit it again but if I was nearby I would stop by for some spinach wraps with chicken and rice!|review|gsyguOgT2Dnjw-OYw14XDw|0|0|0

The owners are friendly and consist ant and I like the fact that you can kick back and have a drink or 2 while your here. I would give them 5 stars, however an amazing Hawaiian place used to be located down the street and tasted even better than Paradise.. its a shame they are gone but Paradise isn't that bad of a substitute.|review|qQb4pg5uqvjMOfGPWbIkeQ|0|0|1

Now, my father loves trying small, locally owned resturants WITHOUT reading reviews on Yelp... so when he picks resturants I am always nervous.   However, I was completly blown away by this location.  I had the chili cheese burger, and the chili was the right amount of spice, and the sweet potato tots were to DIE for.   But the best, BEST part of this resturant, are the sauces.  (I had no idea what they call them... something-yokie?!)  But I was literally begging them to start selling the sauces to go, because the chipotle sauce of tasty goodness was so amazing. I dunked my tots, I smothered my burger.  It was so amazing.   Additionally, the waitress was bubbily, and fun, and very very attentive.   This is what a locally owned burger joint should be.   If I could give this resturant 10 stars I would.   SELL YOUR SAUCES by the bottle! I'd go broke trying them all :)|review|Bf4vI1rkkmX4tP0pvw4mZw|1|1|1

uEJQSIjWui-TDWXaGlcqyQ|2010-07-27|2EUTtGFWrqiIqquqR8Rt7w|5|I heard about Lo-Lo's through its spotlight on Inside the NBA during the NBA Playoffs, and instantly new it was a place I'd have to visit. My fiancee and I went on a Sunday around 11 AM. The place was packed, yet we were seated as soon as we walked in, which was very nice. I was unprepared for the level of deliciousness as I ordered a Betty Boop with Kool-Aid and a side of potato salad. From my first bite of the chicken breast, I could tell this was the best food I've ever eaten. Hands down. I didn't think anything else could top the chicken, but the waffle, which I ate second, actually surpassed it by a good margin. I wouldn't call its taste cinnamon (as a few other reviews have claimed), but there is definitely something in those waffles that makes you want to keep eating, no matter the size of your stomach. The bottom line is that the food at Lo-Lo's drastically exceeded my expectations, and every day I await my next visit. It has since become my favorite place to eat. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys chicken, waffles, and interesting combinations that taste amazing!  On a final note...the price. Before going for the first time, I looked at the menu online and thought it to be a bit pricey. That is, until I actually went and ate the food. Not only is the quality worth the bucks, but the QUANTITY is well over enough. I left stuffed and happy with my fiancee only having to pay ~$25. Not bad, in my opinion.  Please do your taste buds a favor and visit Lo-Lo's soon! You won't regret it.|review|2DCpsscwe7uSrpF8_dClfg|0|0|1

I have picked up some nice vases, electronics, frames, lamps end tables. Its not the Ritz but it is fun to see what you find and sometimes what you need. Wish they took credit cards. An added plus donations are for a good cause!

og7Xi8mwAvhXqDqtWqtt0w|2007-08-28|0-yEOW7sO4cdEqtbyME_Cw|4|What can one say about a single location of a chain restaurant like Del Taco besides: a. They always get my order right (which they do) b. The employees have a great grasp of the English language (which they do)  Well, I can testify that this particular Del Taco made one of my wildest pubescent dreams come true.  It's like this... what teenage boy hasn't mused that if he had a pair of ta-tas, he'd keep himself amused for hours.  I was no different.  Then somewhere in my twenties, Del Taco came strolling into my life, with their thick and creamy strawberry shakes, made with a generous helping of real fruit!  The key to my youthful desire lied within this sweet polar potion... it was called lipids... aka milk fat.  Let me tell you friends, the grass isn't always greener.  I'm not amused... not at all.  There's nothing alluring about a tufted teat.  They bounce; they sag; and they can percolate perspiration like Michael Vick at a PETA rally in Death Valley... on a really hot day.  And no one seems to care.  Seinfeld conceptualized the 'manzier', but I've yet to see one for sale.  I'd have to say my lowest point came while at a water park with friends, one of which brought their new baby.  While relaxing in a lounge chair under the awning by the wave pool, they asked if I wanted to hold little Abigail.  Sure, I love kids.  As I was sitting there with this little cutie, I noticed other people were gawking at me.  When I looked down to check on Abby, I noticed that her mouth was firmly latched on to my right mammary.  That's right children, come suckle daddy's sugarball.  My nonchalant extrication efforts didn't pan out, and the worst part was that I thought I felt seepage.  With pretty much nothing left to lose, I wedged my left index finger between my swollen nip and lil-miss-hoover's mouth until I heard decompression.  Baby-go-back-to-Mama.  In conclusion, I'd like to think there's a lesson here we can all learn from.  Yeah.  ~Swoop|review|pIm17SVRo8IdhGoBD4qbnA|3|14|5

Floor had food on it, table was sticky. 2) The girl at the counter was rude. 3) I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It had no pepper and no peanuts and was EXACTLY the same plate as my friend that ordered Teriyaki chicken. It was neither Kung Pao OR Teriyaki. 4) We asked what was up with the order, they said they were out of peanuts, peppers and teriyaki sauce. 5) We asked for our money back and they refused to refund money even though we did not get what we ordered and did not eat what they gave us. 6) I happened to notice that you also have to pay full price for refills, even tea.  This was over a year ago, but I forgot to rate it then.... Horrible horrible establishment.

It was a little hard to find at night, tucked away in the back of a mostly dark shopping center. However, once we found it, we were seated right away in a cute place that wasn't too frou-frou, nor too relaxed. Perfect for a middle of the week date night.  The bruschetta was so so. I liked the caprese better than Postino's (although not a huge fan of the halved cherry tomatoes) and wasn't a huge fan of the tomato jam, although it wasn't bad.  We shared a small veggie salad - delicious! It was very different, with all sorts of tasty veggies in it. As a vegetarian, it's always nice to find *real* salads with lots of vegetables, instead of the oh-so-common lettuce/tomato/carrot combos.  The best part of the night? The pizza. Now, my partner is from NY, and so were my parents. Usually, I like NY pizza, the real stuff, the end. But when it comes to interesting topping combos, I'm happy to try wood burning oven pizza, and it was soooo worth it. The one we got had potatoes, leeks and gorgonzola on it. What with the apps, splitting one between the two of us was sufficient, but I wished we'd had more to take home.  The service was right on point - both our water and iced tea glasses were always full, our server had excellent suggestions when we asked for them, and we were left alone enough to have good conversation without feeling neglected. Win.  Would be go back? Most certainly!|review|rR5W8Bj-IGu6sw1_1v4m7g|1|0|0

Great!! I was treated to a buffet of fly infested dessert cakes (no seriously I tried to swat a fly away and it was too busy munching on frosting to even fear the death of my hand swat). We also had some burgers and hot dogs with stale buns. A potato salad that still had freezer burn on it. Ok ill just stop there because you might ask why 2 stars?!? Well as we walk back from my second round of getting my money's worth of buffet ($21), me and my lady noticed people with better fresher food. Turns out the hostess didn't tell us it was buffet or you can order off the menu. The waitress was kind enough after hearing our tragic story to comp one buffet price and my lady got to order nice fresh food off the menu at 20% off. Too bad for me I was full off hardened stale bread, freezer burn ice potatoes, and chocolate cake with a side of fly. :-(|review|FMRiEe9KlK_arJYMp9fH5w|0|0|0

On my first visit, we were seated for 20 minutes but never served, as we watched the single waitress hurriedly run around the place. Since we were somewhat hungry/thirsty, we left.  Last night was an improvement (at least we were served), but not by much. I had called a week in advance to avoid my first experience and was told they didn't accept reservations but they'd at least make a note to try to keep two tables ready for my party of 10.  No such tables were ready. No host greeted us, and when I explained the situation to the waiter who was also hurriedly running around, he responded: ""Guess what? Tonight we're short-staffed, too.""  Guess what? Maybe you should hire more people.   The abruptness continued. We were yelled at to get our IDs ready in advance if we wanted to drink, and when my friend didn't have hers out because she came late, the waiter was visibly annoyed. They didn't bring out my other friend's order with the rest of the dinners (to be fair, they comped her meal after she brought this to their attention). I never got a refill on my water or was asked if I wanted a second drink (also to be fair, their $5 martini is pretty decent). The pizza was greasy and unremarkable, and their fried onion strings were really fried batter strings, leaving the onion to the imagination.   Perhaps I happened to come on the worst, short-staffed nights. But I wouldn't risk making that mistake again."|review|ILGInX_7PgGBnur3d0Vx7Q|0|0|4

I LOVE wine, but I usually feel like I'm being tested when I go into wine bars.  This place is so unpretentious, it's a breath of fresh air.  If you don't know exactly what to ask for, the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past, what flavor profiles you prefer, and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like.  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the head! They just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as well...you have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best I've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon!)

It was such fun to watch noodles being made that I couldn't wait to bring Mom over so that she could see it herself.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the place (and restroom) looked very clean.  Really loved the egg rolls!  They're so good, I'm going to have to order them every time I visit.  The noodles were good, but the meat portion of this dish was pretty dismal-- the noodle to meat ration had to have been at least 3 to 1.  No exaggeration!  (I had hoped it was a fluke, but it wasn't-- more detail to come later.)  Once I'd exhausted the beef content (and there wasn't much), I wasn't satisfied enough w/ the noodle flavor to continue.  (If only the noodles were as tasty as those I'd tried at Saigon Bowl the night before...)  There was no doubt, however, that these noodles were freshly made--  I really enjoyed its texture!  Took Mom w/ me on my second visit.  Decided to try the steamed gyoza and a noodle dish w/ ground pork.  Wished I'd ordered the eggrolls, instead :(  The gyoza dish was, without question, the worst WE'D ever tried!  Too heavy on the batter, and steamed was definitely not the way to go.  (Once you have a look at the photos, you'll agree!)  Same thing w/ the pork.  Too crumbly and unexciting flavor (salty and lemony), and again, the meat to noodle ratio was very low.    Two visits, and it's Hit-1, Miss-1.  At least I'll know that the app will be a hit (egg rolls), and if I remember to order a double- or a triple-serving of meat, maybe the noodle portion won't be a miss...|review|0bNXP9quoJEgyVZu9ipGgQ|3|2|9

When they brought the pizza they gave us coupons for two free meals the next time we were there.  The pizza was decent. I thought it had good flavor but was pretty greasy.

Sure, I might have nits to pick here and there, but overall, his restaurants are great places to enjoy the company of good friends with good food.  Service is always top-notch and the food rarely disappoints.  In fact, I struggle to think of  a meal I've not enjoyed in his restaurants.  So anyway, a beautiful fall evening and I've been jonesing to try Olive & Ivy.  We picked up some discount cards at Costco several weeks prior, the oldest daughter was in town and the stars were in alignment.  My entire family actually agreed to go to the same place.  All of us.  The same place.  I know, it was kinda twilight-zonish, but I wasn't gonna break the spell.  We made reservations for the patio and when we arrived, we were taken directly to our table.  Our server quickly got drink orders, the of-age ladies sharing a pitcher of Sangria, me with a Peroni and the youngest with an Arnold Palmer.  It took us a while to order as it was restaurant week, and there was a special menu that provided too many options for my wife to decide.  Eventually we settled on what to do.  A couple plates of Hummus for appetizers, and Caesar salads for the first course.  The Hummus was creamy and delicious, with a slightly chile-enhanced bite.  scooping it up with copious amounts of warm flatbreads, was accompanied by sounds of contentment as we all enjoyed this delicious, savory treat.  The salad was fresh and crisp, consumed quickly and we moved on to the entrees.  I had the Lasagna as did my youngest, my wife had scallops and the oldest had a margherita flatbread.  The Lasagna is served baked in a bowl and was plenty of meaty, cheesy, saucy deliciousness, with a slice of warm garlic bread to help you clean the bowl.  The scallops rested on a bed of Polenta and were quickly devoured by my wife, with her acknowledging that they were sublime.  The flatbread girl loved her dish too, but it was just your basic flatbread.  Dining on the tree-covered patio, next to the Arizona Canal was the perfect atmosphere, ruined only once and shortly by the loud salsa band at some place down the canal.  We took what little leftovers we had, and headed home, fat and happy.  Yes, I would go back."|review|J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ|3|1|4

WSpyF97ml2SUqmoDDpyXHw|2012-09-02|w2vlJbVVPxa4JPlv7Raypg|2|Been to this location twice, but only because my boss asked me to take her car here specifically to get a basic wash inside and out. The employees are nice enough, and the only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star. I can vaguely remember bringing the car in about a year ago and being quite disappointed with the interior specifically, which is what happened this time around. I am not kidding when I say it looked like they didn't vacuum inside AT ALL, which is part of the Deluxe car wash. In addition, this last time I went, when they finished cleaning the car, they drove the car to a really weird area in the middle of the gas station parking lot and didn't even tell us it was done (we were the only ones sitting outside). It was so awkward having to go up to them in the middle of cleaning other cars to ask for the keys. For $18, I felt like I wasted my boss's money. The outside looked better, but not better enough to account for $18. She keeps asking me to bring the car here, but I don't get it. I would much rather take it to a five dollar car wash and vacuum it myself, it would look so much better!|review|PDRWbCZa92irf8mK5X_Kig|0|0|4

They also have a sandwhich station, which is like an awesome upscale Subway, as well as a pasta station.   And the filled cupcakes. FILLED! My biggest complaint about most cupcakes in that all the yummy frosting is on top. Well, dish makes cupcakes with frosting in the middle. Heaven.  Dish is clean, sunny and spacious with very friendly and helpful staff. I never have to wait too long in the salad line and they are really cool about letting you sample before you buy. I have not eaten in the formal sit down section of Dish, but the DIY stations, bakery, coffee bar and deli case are all top notch.

Where do I begin.....Hmmmm.....to start, no one was around their MASSIVE parking lot when we attempted to return our car.  NO ONE.  There was a sign that said ""E-receipt here"".  Sounded OK.  It took forever just to get the car, and we got a free tank of gas because of it, so an E-receipt sounds good, right?  Just drop off the car and catch our flight, especially since there was no one around?  Hah!  no.  Apparently, when we approached the customer service desk to turn in the keys,  the customer service guy said that using that line was for preferred customers only, and we needed to get back in the car and FIND the check out employee!!!  We asked why it didn't specifically say that E-receipts were for preferred customers, and were told that ""if you were a preferred customer, you would've just known.""  I don't need to guess what their stupid promo lines mean, not my job, I'm a CUSTOMER.  We also mentioned to this guy that we couldn't find anyone to check out our car.  He begins arguing that there IS someone out there---a woman--he ""swears"" she's out there, somewhere.  My husband, fed up told the guy to either check us out officially, or we were throwing him the damn keys and leaving to catch our flight either way.  We don't need a manual about what their signs mean, and we don't need to go chasing down their employees so that they can do their jobs, so he better get his ass on over and check us out, because we'd had it with him and AVIS.  He checked us out.  THEN, the (manager?) came out to see what was up.  He was one of the guys who didn't have it together when we got the car, and gave us a tank of gas for taking forever.  We let him know how pathetic the checkout procedures were, how pathetic their signage was, and how unavailable their personnel was.  Enterprise has these guys beaten hands down.  We will NEVER, EVER rent from AVIS again.  If you do, then just know---you've been warned!!!"|review|AvFXs9lbRhV23qcMi-MaOw|0|0|0

The little salad(which was well garnished & tasted great), fried plantains (1 word- awesome) on the side added some value to the otherwise pricey meal ($9.50).

I've eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants in MD, IL, and DC and this one rates high on my list. My husband and I went with my sister who is not a vegetarian. We had the channa masala, matar paneer, garlic naan, and puri. My sister ordered the mixed kabobs. We loved our dishes. They were flavored perfectly. The breads were just ok. We are used to garlic naan that is more fluffy and buttery. This naan was pretty thin and did not have the butter glistening on it. The puri was not very flavorful. The breads were not bad, just not the greatest. Next time I will try the bhatura. My sister liked her dish a lot. Her dish consisted of lamb, chicken, fish, and shrimp all prepared with different spices. The presentation was pretty cool.  The service was great from the time we walked in the door. The place wasn't crowded when we went. There were two people waiting tables and they were both pleasant and attentive to their customers. Decor is very nice. There are some wires on the ceiling that they could cover up, but that does not take away from the ambiance. My sister was bothered that there was some spilled rice on the floor that no one felt the need to clean up. There was no one dining near that table so for me it was not a deal breaker. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will enjoy the food, decor, staff, and don't forget to take a stroll around the grounds outside of the restaurant... very nice.|review|8ByteGqSuEyfK2pGDC_BmQ|0|0|1

After driving by, I finally parked in the lot and took a survey of the building.   1. Nice outdoor patio 2. Clean and New 3. Small 4. Looked packed  So I walk in and there was 3 patrons. 2 young guys and 1 US Senator. Yep that is right, a full fledged Senator. Don't ask who because I cannot remember.   So the 3 people made the place looked packed. I told you it was small.   I was greeted right away by the owner. He is a really nice guy who cares about the food he serves. We spoke about the recent call his wife received from DINERS DRIVE INS AND DIVES. She asked the caller to not pull her husbands leg, because he is a huge fan and it would be a thrill to be on the show.   The DDD reviewers spotted 2 Hippies via YELP! She explained he has a 4 star rating and tons of reviews. He was unaware of Yelp but took it as a compliment. ( I bet he looks today) HI!  The food is a healthy Mexican food menu. I sampled the taco trio of fish, beef and chicken. All 3 where wonderful, you sure can taste freshness. The favorite was the fish. $5 with a Coke.  The other items are quesidillas, burritos, tacos, etc.   I tried both the red and the green salsa. The red is boring and the green is good. Neither of them will make you burn your mouth. He is tweaking the salsa so be sure to rate it if it gets better.   I will return when in the area FO SHO.  Well the return was on 10-7-08.   I had the taco trio constisting of green beef taco, carne asada taco and red chile taco. They were all good but the green was the best of the 3.  The salsa needs a makeover. I was hoping for a better flavor this time. The green is good but sweet, the red is bad. Maybe a little ""mexican"" in it wouldn't be bad.   Do not go here expecting greasy, gut  buster, cheese covered everything MEXICAN food. Go here expecting a healthier, fresh tasting meal. The food is prepared by a fat white guy and cooked by a Mexican guy. (not that that matters, my mom-in-law makes killer mexican food and she is white)"|review|C6IOtaaYdLIT5fWd7ZYIuA|3|1|5

The bad news is that we got delivery last night and used a brand new credit card that we'd had for 6 months and never used.  Guess what happened today?  Visa fraud called and said that the card number was used 3 times before they caught it.

Maybe they wrote it down and didn't shred it and some bum dug it out of their garbage, but I dont' care.  Somehow the info was misused.

And what the birthday girl wants, the birthday girl gets... so off we went! This was literally my First Watch - I had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it.   The inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out, very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright. It definitely gives off a ""Good Day Sunshine"" breakfast vibe.  We sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth, and I began to scan the menu. The options looked decent but boring, and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet, egg, bacon, pancake, griddle, wrap, sandwich and salad dishes. First Watch also has ""The Healthier Side"" - a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline. I thought that was a nice touch.   The coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it, very unimpressive. I ordered the No. 5 - an Asian salad with chicken, romaine lettuce (yuck), wontons, cashews, cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side. This salad was not impressive at all, and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce. I just picked at it throughout the entire meal.   The birthday girl ordered the Black 'n Blue Wrap - roast beef, blue cheese, tomato, lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. She was impressed with her meal, so maybe I should have gotten a wrap instead! However, I probably won't go back for my Second Watch to find out.   Overall, First Watch is decent. The service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre. The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy. So if I had to compare, I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality, presentation and flavor is much better.   If you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area, I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg. In my opinion, their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger."|review|w4suxL1zlxsihVlugZZDAQ|1|1|2

I hesitate to review it, for fear that the out-of-towners will find it.  You'd have to know where it is though, because the tourists are not going to accidentally stumble upon it.  It's in the middle of the hood in Phoenix.  The only thing setting it apart from the other old-school business fronts with barred windows is the giant mosaic Day of the Dead Catrina above the door.  Known as a ""gourmet taco place"" to locals, the menu also features burros and quesadillas.  Where else can you get a shark soft taco or a Mahi Mahi burro?  I have no idea, but you can get them here.  My husband loved his Mahi Mahi burro.  I had a more traditional Carne Asada soft taco.  All their flour tortillas are hand made, and fresh.  And did I mention the salsa bar?  About 20 different kinds of salsa for you to try, with the chips that keep coming to the table.  My favorite was the creamy cilantro one.  There are also peanut and pecan based salsas, so those with nut allergies, take note.  You may not expect nuts in your food, so pay attention.  Seating is limited, (maybe 10 tables) and the restaurant was full when we were there, for lunch, in the middle of the week.  If you have a group larger than 4, it would probably be wise to call ahead.  Parking is also limited, just the few spaces on the street in front.  The only slightly disconcerting element was the giant mural of Frida Khalo.  It's a little odd to be stared at by a giant portrait of a mustached woman while eating such wonderful food.  We liked it so much that my husband took my dad there.  My dad is a notoriously finicky eater (which means I probably came by it naturally), and he is still talking about it a week later.

This is a typical UPS store with packaging materials for purchase and mailboxes to rent.  I was particularly happy with the service that I received from the lady who waited on me.  I arrived to the store about 3 or 4 minutes before they opened.  She saw me outside and opened the door.  I appreciated her not making me wait the 3 or 4 minutes and she let me come into the store.

(Although I will say that it does not hold up well for leftovers, it tends to get really mushy).  I really like the cheese plate and it has a good selection of beers.  Plus they have a homemade Limencello that is perfect for a digestif.  The dessert crepes are really good and perfect for sharing.  For really big groups you can ask for the carriage house.

Because SoCal sets the standard. This may be an unfair advantage but I'd like to think, I've come across the best or at least above average places that I'd like to see duplicated out here.   I recently visited this cafe for lunch. The menu online was not as diverse as I'd hope. But the fact that a crepes cafe exists in the East Valley was enough for me to trek out to Ahwatukee for the afternoon. I didn't know what to expect from Ahwatukee since I never go out in that direction. It didn't have the same flavor of La Creperie in Long Beach but that is downtown Long Beach and it's where diversity lives and breathes. Tucked away in a strip mall, this little cafe stood out among the other stores/restaurants with it's signage and decor. It was a friendly cafe that seemed inviting for a casual meal and laid back ambiance.   I ordered the veggie delight and I tried with all my might to really like it. There was nothing special about it. It was dry from the spinach to the tomato down to the cheese. Absolutely dry. No sauce or flavor. My friend also ordered off the ""savory lunch menu"" and felt her meal was bland as well. We wanted to like it but it just wasn't what we had in mind.   I gave the cafe 3 stars because the owner was very patient with us as we took our time ordering. The chai was good not stellar but good. And overall the experience was fine. I just hope that they put the ""savory"" aspect back in the meals by adding a little sauce or flavor to the dishes. This place has great potential and it would be ashamed to see the only local crepes place disappear like most businesses in the East Valley."|review|D6f_3rWBlSGx1lvt1g49AA|1|0|2

I did talk the hubby into ""looking"" at a new vacuum and compare models. I wasn't in there 5 minutes and out comes a really nice lady asking me if I want help or if she could get me a vacuum from the back. I  wasn't totally convinced I wanted to buy one yet, but since she was there and bored and very nice I thought I'd humor her. She went to find the model I pointed to and here came 2 older gents to see if I needed more help. I felt like I was Princess Dianna...God rest her soul. (thanks also for my hubby not lookin like hers) yuckies! Anyway I had 3 people helping me and no luck on the model I liked being in stock and they were on back order online. Then I was swamped with what I could do or what I wanna do. They gave me the choice of buying at this location and picking up in Gilbert. I took it and we ran off to customer service. Steve my salesman says he has never done this before and then I got 3 more people trying to figure out how it's supposed to work. Some new thing they do called oms something. They get me all fixed up and send me to Gilbert for my new toy. This bunch was just as nice and friendly as the other ones, so it made my experience much less painful. By the way Hoover Vacuums work really well and much cheaper and longer warranty than that $600.00 Dyson.

The food quality was lacking - oversalted and grisley steak, greasy quesadilla my daughter rung out before eating and wilted lettuce strewn about the plates.  All of the prices are REALLY high for the quality of the food and it seems like there are NO more affordable options.  Even the kids menu is high ($5.50 plus extra for juice) and their emphatic NO SUBSTITUTIONS is frustrating.  The happy hour menu looks more promising but for a Family, it's a NO THANK YOU.

There wasn't much chicken but a lot of arugula and apples. I'm okay with some diced apple as a garnishment but there were so many that it overpowered the sandwich and made it too sweet.

I lived in SF and now live in Marin, don't get the hippy name, and would expect it to look the part and to serve food in keeping with the name - they don't beyond the Portobello mushroom burger.  Visited at about 3:30PM for a late lunch, place was empty but me.  The make your own burger to me is a pain, all the items you can select are scribbled across a blackboard behind the counter, but for others I am sure it may be what brings them here - different strokes for different folks.  Save yourself the strain and pick up a menu, give yourself about 5 minutes to select what you would like.  For me too many choices usually mean the product produced if bad ""must be your fault"".  I had a burger on sourdough, with jalapenos, cheese and guacamole, and my side was onion rings.  The rings were good, the burger not so - over cooked, too loaded with jalapenos, cheese fell off it in gobs and sandwich ultimately fell apart.  Just not good.  The lemonade is okay, not memorable but not bad.  A burger is $7.00, that's over double the cost (almost a dollar more) of two DOUBLE-DOUBLES at In & Out.  I&O is not a bad burger, but not great, but vastly superior to Two Hippies Gnarly Burger Joint.  I just don't get all the 4 and 5 STARS.  I wouldn't recommend and was very sadly disappointed.   I will not be back any time soon."|review|Sz1uwnT3pxuEECjEn449BQ|1|0|3

I didn't even realize a live person was playing as I was hidden away in a corner and couldn't see him on the ""stage"". I actually said ""wow, this is live!"" The acoustics are great in the place, with vaulted ceilings and brick walls. The art sporadically hung throughout the bar is interesting and offers nice eye candy, besides the patrons and beer. They serve wine as well, but no hard liquor or draft beer. So all you mix drinkers, stay away, please we don't want you here anyway. Yes, this place is for the hipster, emo, punk, artsy, angst driven snob. but hey we need our Old Town Scottsdale too damn it!  This area near the Roosevelt and the Art Walk is OUR Old Town.

I had the Chicken and Cheddar sandwich, it's very basic. Chicken, Cheese, Bread (lettuce, tomato, pickles) but it was phenomenal. I also added a cup of vegetable soup which was surprisingly very tasty.   I ordered online this time, my sandwich was ready but they still needed to scoop the soup which I appreciated. Nothing worse than cold soup.|review|GoymUzKqvET2QOZkIWZi9w|0|1|0
4DhqZ0tyi2V2Mp8IqTREAA|2011-01-10|mNX5lxrKzf7M55Ng1ekj0A|2|Was so in the mood for BBQ after a round of golf yesterday! We stopped in for take-out, and I have to tell you I was very excited. I love BBQ and rarely get to indulge since my wife isn't a big fan. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. The restaurant itself is exactly what you'd expect for great BBQ -- picnic tables, lots of paper towels, cool bar off to the side. I really liked the atmosphere. As we waited for our order, I daydreamed about eating lots of messy BBQ with the guys after my next round of golf. The experience from there was less than positive. Even though I was just there ordering take-out, the two guys at the register weren't very helpful and the wait was pretty long for take-out. The real disappointment came when I saw how little food we got for $90. The BBQ was ok, but it's definitely over-priced for what you get. If you go, I'd recommend the wings and the Tri Tip sandwich, but steer clear of the combo plates. If you have kids, have them split a meal and stay away from the kid meals. Only four puny over-cooked and over-breaded chicken nuggets that my kids didn't like -- and they love all chicken nuggets. If you love BBQ and are a big eater, bring extra money and order big.|review|WJhAKYIAKyrdFnTnjuM44Q|0|0|0

RdOQN8LEzo5tB_pSIS-I5w|2011-11-16|uuzLAmnm8EfTJCEIdPdOvg|1|"My sister and I received a coupon for a 50 minute FULL BODY massage for $20.  We called ahead and knew it was first come first serve.  So when we arrived and signed in, we were prepared to wait.  The wait on Sunday, however was 2 hours and 30 minutes.  When we were finally called she was taken first and then I was taken.  On my way to the room the girl who was going to be doing my massage told me that she was set to do some sort of cranial massage.  I didn't understand that this was completely different from a full-body massage and was not going to be given a massage at all.  To be clear, there was no circular hand movements at all.  I was asked to remove my shoes and lay on my back...which is where I remained for the duration of 40 minutes.  She pressed on my feet, calves, hips, upper arms and shoulders.  Placed her hands in a ball on my cheek, eyebrows and then flat over my eyes and forehead.  Then she stuck her fingers into the back of my neck and head.  That was it.  I was sorely disappointed that she was not more clear with her explanation of what I was receiving.  Working in Marketing, I know how important it is to be clear with your customers.  Telling me that I would not be receiving a full-body massage but, instead, a random poking, would have been more clear and also would have given me the opportunity to decline and ask for someone else. She didn't use any lotion or spray and continued to yawn in my ear.  She sat the entire time and at points I could feel her laying her head down on the massage table.  Apparently, Saturday night had gotten to her and my ""massage"" was taking up valuable nap time.    Either way...I called to complain and I was told that I was not going to be receiving any sort of a refund as I had already received my massage.  I assured the woman on the phone that what I got was an abrupt poking for close to an hour and could no way be considered a full value for what I paid or what was advertised on the coupon.  I was also told a manager, who was conveniently not in that day, would be calling me back on Monday and now (two weeks later) have still heard nothing.    I know they don't need my business, but they could use some additional positive reviews on merchant sites like this...this, however, isn't going to be one of those positive reviews.  Save your $20 and get a pedicure instead."|review|AgIa6HAfLukzD2bvrsTlUA|2|5|4

But there's something about this place that didn't quite gel with me, and I can't put my finger on it. The drinks are cheap, and they serve a righteously cold beer. But I guess it's the big, vast feel of the place with the off-putting fluorescent lighting. It gives the place a very bowling alley feel. I don't see this as a place where you and your crew would want to hang for very long. However, if you've been out drinking all night, are short on cash and just need to knock back another one or two before calling it a night while sitting in shameful silence already starting to regret how awful you're going to feel in the morning, this place would be perfect.|review|wNqwKWaRjClmcKsoJJRFow|2|2|2

I always feel like I am on vacation there. The drinks are the best. The meals are okay. They have a decent ahi tuna salad. This is how you do it right. Go on a nice spring day, sit outside at the patio bar, go with a pal (I worked in Kierland for awhile, so this was like my after work hang out) order a mojito or margarita, order appetizers like the coconut shrimp or the macadamia nut goat cheese, and get a slice of the best dessert ever created: the pina colada cake. Literally, the best cake in the world. I order a whole one (like $60... YIKES!!!) every year from my moms birthday. You gotta order those in advance!

-wymeGehHwL9ALaE_NFCXA|2008-12-29|2dZkvv1E4kKDRpTiBgmfAg|4|So... this is the only reason to go to Cripstown, I mean Christown. What a shithole ghetto ass excuse for a mall, it's even more ghetto than Metro Center.   On the other hand, Costco rulez.  Their 'store brand' of Kirkland products are super high quality, ad priced low. My dogs love their dogfood. I love their butcher and seafood section, and there is always a great selection of very reasonably priced fresh produce. They have great prices on a limited selection of DVD and Blu Ray disks. They have a great wine and liquor selection, with excellent prices. Eyeglasses. Clothing, Towels. Beds. BBQs. Bicycles. Pharmacy. Car tires. Electronics. If you are a member, you can go to any Costco, and they pretty much are all the same.   As for this location.... despite being in Cripstown, it's great. The only downside is that the area that sells ready to eat pizza, hot dogs, etc is facing the mall... meaning all the ghetto ass motherfuckers who aren't Costco members share my oxygen while on line. I wish they would charge non members more for the food items, or have a members only line. Oh well.  Recommendation - park in the BACK parking lot, off Montebello, not on the Bethany Home side which is full of mall goers.|review|HZeFzs42f0iGaA-sP_hUnA|9|9|7

I had looked in several groceries in North Scottsdale and finally stopped into Sportsman's to see if they had it. They didn't, but a very nice gentleman offered to call his distributor. He soon called me back (that same day) and said that the distributor could get some for me if I wanted it. Hallelujah! I ordered two bottles, and the same gentleman called me a few days later to let me know it had arrived. He was so friendly, helpful and polite. The store has a good selection of wines as well - it's small but well stocked. Even better is that if they don't have what you need, chances are they will happily get it for you.

The margaritas aren't top shelf, but for the price they can't be beat (and who really cares after the fourth or fifth one?!!). I've had better chips, but the salsa is killer and the wait staff is  good at making sure you always have some of each. Service is generally super fast and the food is consistently good.  IMHO the Baja Chicken Burro is the best thing on the menu and it's huge - I easily get two meals out of it. The chicken is nicely seasoned and moist, but the best part is the baja sauce that can only be described as bubbly goodness (or as mom would say - lick it off your body good).  Go on a Thursday (or early Friday) night and they will offer up some of their unbelievably yummy rice pudding. This isn't your mother's rice pudding either... it's the slow cooked; OMG my arm is going to fall off because I've been stirring this damn pot for 2 hours, pudding kind. And bless their hearts they will even pack it up for you to take home and enjoy later if you have reached your gastral limit.  Top everything off with a piece of bazooka on your way out and you definitely won't be disappointed.|review|iwWBF3nKoRMoy1sbkLJwvg|3|4|4

I haven't seen on of these places in quite awhile.  I honestly figured the info was outdated, but it was the closest location to catch the Cardinals game...  What do ya know... it's here!  From the outside I figured it was dead.  One couple was on the patio watching a football game.  When I walked in though, almost every seat was filled.  I think every game was on TV or on many TVs.  I didn't count them, but I think they must have have 25 TVs.  The Cards game was on 25-30% of the TVs including the big screen in the bar.  So...  I grabbed the only booth I saw available and sat my butt down and ordered some chili and a coke.  The chili was pretty good.  It seemed to be better than a freshly opened can of Hormel, with more meat than beans and topped with onions and cheese.  Perfect afternoon snack.  The service was OK.  I got helped within a few minutes of sitting down and she checked back every few minutes.  My soda was delivered in a couple minutes and my chili came within 5.

We had been wanting to try this place for weeks as a location opened up just blocks from our house, glad we finally got around to it. We sat on the patio because the dining room was cold and crowded especially for a Wednesday night in a suburban area. there was a barrier between the tables and the parking lot so it kept most of the headlights and noise out.  Appetizer was the caprese burrata which was a mild let down because they give you a very small amount of burrata and it's already out of the shell, not like the photo at all. Still tasty though. Pizzas were fig & prosciutto and BBQ chicken. Fig & prosciutto definitely won that contest. Our waitress was a little sullen and dressed very casually in shorts that were more than a little short and tight , we noticed this about the staff , they were all dressed in street clothes. You couldn't tell who was a staff member and who was a guest. we found this odd mostly because the women either had bra straps hanging out, jeans that were torn and dirty, or shorts that were far too short or tight. Caused most patrons to stare and make comments as they walked by. Maybe this should be addressed? It definitely takes away from the ambiance.  Food was good enough to bring us back again. We will try happy hour next time.|review|SkRLZojKusTNAugGWQ_ksA|0|0|0

It comes with dipping bread to go into the sauce and I didn't care how unhealthy it may have been. It was good.   The crab dip with fried bananas was good, and the fried green tomatillos were okay.

The decor is old and they don't have booths which is always a downer, but the place is always clean. the service is average Asian food service, they get your order, refill your water, and bring you your food, no real interaction. Whenever I have asked about ingrediants they have always been knowledgable, and helpful in picking out non meat meals when I asked, so I would have to say their service isn't bad, just not uhh outgoing.

I ordered my bacon cheeseburger (plus 5 toppings since they are all free) and fries and waited in anticipation of my delicious meal. Not only did I have to wait 30 minutes for my order to be ready for me to take with me to eat (since I ordered it to go) but when I had my 1st bite I realized that they only placed 2 toppings on the burger (forgot the other 3) and forgot the bacon that I paid extra for. To say the least I was hugely disappointed and went on to tell all my co-workers what a huge let down it was. I would have walked back and asked them to fix my order but since I didn't have another 30 minutes to wait for 5 Guys to attempt to make it correctly I tossed what I was given.  I do not anticipate that I will ever eat at 5 guys again since I have another burger place (i.e. Fatburger) to choose from that can get my order right that is only a few steps further from my place of work.

Their wine selection is great and if you don't like something, they take it back and help try and suggest something that might be better. The Bruschetta is damn good too.

gRt4zXBVY_Z-bieKA5lq_g|2010-03-10|LSvKG67Lldw37nrf1n1Hiw|4|I'm a sushi addict and so far Kabuki has been feeding my addiction well and better than any other sushi bar in the West Valley.   It is more Americanized sushi, but the fish is always fresh and top quality.  The only two complaints I have are that sometimes customer service is lacking and there seems to be a lot of specialty rolls made from the base of a California roll.  If you eat California rolls, that is not sushi in my book so I'm not a fan of seeing it all over the menu.    Other than that the food always comes out quickly, everything tastes great and is very fresh, and the whole vibe is relaxing.  It's very modern Asian decor that looks like an expensive restaurant but the prices are extremely fair.  They are always playing modern music that is hot at the moment which caters to most of the younger crowd that eats here.  The bar is stylish and the wine/sake list is quite good.    Some of my favorites have been the Lychee saketini, Sake Sangria, sesame chicken appetizer, spicy tuna roll, sunkissed roll, rose roll, uni, and the pyramid roll.  They also have a Red Mask club you can sign up for that gives you a $25 gift certificate for every $500 you spend over time and discounts on birthdays/anniversaries.|review|oqy20AAbKISJWSTa_oBJpQ|0|0|1
FqzgT9Y-Yu7jiWdHnGW-kQ|2009-03-17|wngQjm0AaAfdEMMSyehKkQ|4|"This is a pretty chill place if you want to grab a few drinks with your friends and relax.  The place has a really good vibe to it.  I heard some good things about it so I figured I would give it a try for dinner.  We went on a Monday night at about 7:30ish and it was not very crowded.  We sat at a booth inside because it was still a bit cool outside.  The patio is nice with lots of seating and I would like to come back and relax outside with a few drinks in the future.  For an appetizer we initially ordered their grilled hot wings, but it turns out they are fried for some reason before they are grilled.  I don't understand why they say ""grilled"" when they are grilled AND fried.  Anyway, the other 2 members of my party don't do fried foods so we didn't order them.  Other patrons at another table had them and they did look good tho.  We ordered our meals and a side of their sweet potato fries to share.  I forgot to say we wanted them with our meals so they brought them out before (I still don't understand why people in Arizona like having a side of fries before their meals...).  We told them to please take the fries back because we wanted them with our meals.  Our waitress looked at us funny then took them back.    We waited another 10 minutes for our salad to arrive but ended up asking our waitress about it because we were getting hungry.  She got confused again and thought that we told her to serve our salad with our main courses (and the fries).  5 minutes later we had our meals with the fries AND our salad.  I ordered the Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake.  It was very unique and very good.  I would definitely order it again.  I also tried the grilled salmon which was also very very good.  The sweet potato fries were ok and the dipping sauce they served with them was just weird.  The Caesar salad was also just ok.  The portion sizes were good as was the quality of the food.  The prices I thought were a bit high for what you get, but it wasn't too bad.  For 3 of us to eat it was about $80 without alcohol.    I think I would come back when I am in the mood to shoot the breeze for a few hours, have 4 or 5 drinks and try some interesting food.  I hear they have a pretty good happy hour so that would be interesting to check out."|review|rLtl8ZkDX5vH5nAx9C3q5Q|1|1|3
yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw|2011-08-26|SPFK-q1TuFyvxjizs2Xh9w|3|Wife and I went for an early dinner with our daughter and grandson. Service was on the slow side.  They seemed to be understaffed tonight.  We waited a good ten minutes before our server showed up at our table. We ordered the Strawberry salad, Arugula pizza, S.O.P (Sausage, grilled oinions & peppers)& Kids chicken tenders, ice teas & a glass of wine. Plenty of salad to share for our group. Salad was quite tasty.  Pizzas were also very good although the SOP could have used a couple more minutes in the oven -- little mushy in the center. After pizza was served that was pretty much it as far as seeing our server again until it was time for the check. No tea refills. No second glass of wine.  Oh the waitress did come back once with the catchup my grandson wanted for his fries. She also took his glass for a soda refill when he asked for the catchup but set it down unfilled when she brought the catchup.  I think it was just a bad night for a short handed wait staff.   One other thought on Humble Pie -- Don't plan on coming here for a quiet dinner. It is a very noisy setting. Conversation was near impossible.   Food is really quite good.  Next time I think I'll just do takeout.|review|7w-dOYtnjBzYe6hMBqwltQ|0|0|0

Decided to give it a try.  Soup was excellent. I had the roast pork soup. Friend had vegetarian soup with shrimp.  True, the place is not fancy, but our first taste of the soup was great.  We took it to go - which I probably won't do again if only because you have to ""assemble"" the soup at home. By the time we got home, the broth wasn't that hot anymore. However, after heating everything up in a pot with all the ingredients, it was delicious.  I'd probably opt to dine-in next time to save the extra step of having to heat it up at home.  Highly recommended. Can't wait to try more of their soups!"|review|EC0dvtgaBswNCTUpElqykQ|0|0|0
3EEVGDngt4DEhoOQZIUNUw|2011-05-29|FE5Xm_4muGFxQN3eaqsBJA|3|I came to the Phoenix Art Museum with my grandparents to see the GORGEOUS collection of clothes and accessories of Ann Bonfoey Taylor. (My new role model. Seriously, look her up. How fabulous and fancy. I need 54 little pill box hast please, stat.) Before perusing the rest of the museum, we stopped in the Cafe for lunch.   (10% off for members! Make sure to remind your server.)  The dining room was very nice and open...tons of sunny light coming in from the walls of windows, which was delightful. Had the temp been cooler than almost 100 degrees, I'd have loved to sit out on their patio. Like other reviews have noted, it took a bit too long for everything to get rolling: To get sat, to have a server come over, to get water, to get our order taken, for the food to come, etc. Nothing *terrible* but...come on peeps. Pep in your step!  It's a pretty nice menu for vegetarians; each section (apps, salads, sandwiches, entrees) has a few meatless meals. I opted for the Greek salad because 1) I wuv Greek salads and 2) I saw it came with it's own portion of hummus and pita. Heyo!  Hey-NO. The hummus was more of a...chickpea mash and that's IT.  I was so confused, since there were obvious amounts of SOME kind of green herb (Parsley? Cilantro? WHAT?) but it didn't taste like ANYTHING. No Tahini, no zip of lemon juice, no cumin...NOTHING. I'm just going to have to make my own hummus this week, since I make the best in the universe.  The salad, however, was a delight. It's a big portion (as it should be, for $12) and comes with fresh greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, kalamatas, tons of red onion (lucky for me, I love red onion), whole chickpeas and feta. There wasn't too much dressing overpowering the thing, which is such a salad deal-breaker. It almost made me forget my hummus heartbreak. Almost!  Like I said, service was fine and friendly, just weirdly slow. Thurs-Sun there some deal where if you buy a bottle of wine, you get a cheese board for free. Boom! I need to find some friends in AZ and take part in that deal!|review|qaSf-CGQLWlXmy56pkYQYw|1|1|1

I came here with my co-workers on a night that wasn't very busy, and we had very good service, but it was just slow enough that it was on the verge of being not-so-great service.  I wasn't blown away by the drinks, but where I found this place's strengths was in the food. I had the Durango, which was basically a sampler plate featuring a chile relleno, a chicken mole enchilada, and a spinach enchilada. The chile relleno was tender and really brought out the flavor of the pepper, which I like more than the cheese-filled disasters that some restaurants serve. The chicken mole enchilada was delicious, I especially enjoyed the mole sauce. The spinach enchilada stood out the least but it was very tasty, just not as good as the other two dishes.  We also had very good guacamole and chips before our meal, and they were cool about us adding several more people to the table as the night went on. At the end of the night we had a decent sized bill (that my boss was cool enough to cover) so I don't think this is exactly the cheapest food in Scottsdale, but I would definitely go back.|review|ocAdK8ZkyZTrHOnP1dRwcw|0|0|0

After watching the defeat of the NOMNOM truck on Great Truck Race on Food Network, my tummy was curious and I've heard from Cali friends that this was the go to spot.   FYI I'm pesco-vegetarian and because my boyfriend will do whatever I tell him to, he also does not eat meat, so my selection was between the avocado, sardine and vegetarian. After standing in front of the menu for what seemed to be the greater part of my day I decided on the latter two.   I honestly did not expect to get how much I did for only $6. I've never been a sandwich person but this beats Subway any day. I love Vietnamese food and flavors and here they were in a convenient little bread pocket, which they make fresh on the daily.

He measured our floors, asked what we were looking for, made some helpful suggestions, and gave us a quote. He was not at all pushy.   By the time he left, we were booked to have our new floors put in on Thursday. On Wednesday, he called and said that they didn't have enough flooring material in stock and they would have to do our floors next week. We could have easily backed out with no consequences if we didn't want to wait. But we decided to just wait. Because we weren't going to get our original date, Josh gave us $200 off the price...just like that.  The team came to our house on the scheduled day. They were also professional.

We were amazed by the $3 carafes with your choice of: bloody mary, mimosa, screwdriver, and cape cod. We started with a very boozy screwdriver carafe. We both ordered tasty side salads (caesar & field) for the low price of $2.25. My friend got the mac and cheese ($11), she loved it. I ordered the crepes huevos rancheros. Muy delicioso! Light, fluffy crepes filled with goodness. They happily substituted the chorizo for mushrooms to accommodate my veg-ness. The breakfast potatoes also had a good flavor. $10 and I had leftovers. We then ordered a cape cod carafe, again - very boozy.   Our server was friendly, hip and great aside from not checking on us at the beginning of our meal. I require hot sauce with every morsel of food I eat. My friend wandered over to the chef as there was a slew of hot sauce in the kitchen opening. Straight to the source she goes - they apparently have a friendly chef.   The outdoor patio is very inviting.

(Was cut off at my old house too soon, having issues getting service at the new place.) I don't have a smart phone - so I really need internet access to coordinate the move and stay in touch with the outside world.  Denny's and Starbucks lost my interest very quickly. I needed wifi access, and I am more than happy to be a paying customer to get it. Oh, and I keep a late night schedule.  Enter Jerry's. Not far from the new house, open 24/7, and wifi access as requested.  Until this past week, I hadn't been into Jerry's in almost 20 years. I am so sorry it fell off my radar - this is a great place for a quick and affordable meal anytime day or night. And - quite the happy surprise - the food is pretty damn tasty!  Late night, visit #1 - I wasn't really hungry, but thought it would be tacky to just nurse an iced tea, so I was going to get a slice of dessert. (Offerings were apple, cherry, Boston Creme and Lemon Meringue pie, Chocolate or Lemon cake.) Then the waitress mentioned something about the awesome cinnamon roll with whipped butter, and that sounded perfect. AND IT WAS!  Late morning - visit #2 - Coffee and a Reuben sandwich with fries. Quite possibly the best diner Reuben a girl could ask for! YUM.  Lunch time - visit #3 - I brought a friend today. (Cox was supposed to connect me this morning, she was going to set up my home network. That didn't happen, so the least I could do was buy her lunch.) She had iced tea and a grilled club, I had iced coffee and a hamburger. I was super happy. Her only complaint was all the bacon seemed to be on one side of the sandwich - so she had to open it up to rebalance.  I am happy to have Jerry's nearby - and will most likely be in fairly often  - even when I can access the internet at home. Breakfast 24 hours a day? Yummy desserts? Friendly servers? Reasonable prices? Check, check, check and CHECK!|review|45V7-1r79DEG0HbuaKYIlg|0|0|1

Literally meaning ""those who have gone,"" this was the name given to the mysterious Indian culture that thrived in the southwest of Arizona between AD 1 and 1500.  Known throughout the southwest for the irrigation canals, pottery, and ruins they left behind, this is one of the parks that brings you closer to this culture. Though the ruins are little more than mounds, due to building materials back then being in limited supply (i.e. adobe, caliche, and if you got lucky - some logs) and heat and monsoons eroding away what once was, there are some wonderful full scale homes (replicas) for visitors to explore. Picture the teepees we know and love in the Westerns, now replace the furs and leather with the surrounding soil.  I can't imagine that their villages were easy to sustain, though their exceedingly large ballcourts survive to this day, seen here at Pueblo Grande.  Walk the trails and walk in the footsteps of this ancient culture, trace the foundations of their homes, look at pottery which has been found at the site, learn about the amazing irrigation canals that helped their civilization thrive as a successful farming community for 1500 years. Advice: never come here unless it is below 85 degrees.  Locals can talk all they want about it being a dry heat, but you will be doing a lot of walking while here. Admission is $2, that's all the city gets for sponsoring the research, tours, talks, digs, and displays.   If you are bored to tears just thinking about walking amidst almost non-existent ruins, visit the visitor center museum and gawk at the artifacts found in or around the site.  Kids can be archeologists for a day and dig around in their life-size excavated trench."|review|HjhR3u17OjxD4s8t3toTfg|1|0|0

Ronnie was my server tonight and he was attentive and cute without being overbearing while Juan Carlos was our server a week ago and he was very attentive and conversational.  The drinks are fabulous. They do not skimp on the booze and are reasonably priced while being tasty.   Love the decor...very Tiki and open concept with the patio being the best with the numerous tables and fire-pit.  I'm cheating in that I've only tried a few things and am still giving this place 5 stars! The sweet potato fries are amazing...probably the best I've had. You can't really screw up bacon and an English muffin and hash browns can you??   I'll be back but I'm sure my review won't change.|review|S6NrF2WuiJXp9BbWEDpcHQ|1|0|0

Course 1- Duck Confit, elderberries, and cornbread with a side of French Fries fried in duck fat (paprika dusted with some bbq sauce, pepper dusted with aioli, and salted with ketchup.  This was the best course BY FAR.  These french fries were out of this world and the duck was as tender as osso buco. Course 2- Flat Iron Steak cooked medium rare.  Very good piece of steak and they did the best with flat iron that I've ever head. Course 3- Rocky Road Ice Cream with homemade marshmallows.  Great ending to a great meal.  Lighter than most chocolate desserts, which is fine by me.  Drinks- Were decent and this keeps it from getting 5 stars.  If I'm spending $16 for a cocktail, it better be incredible.  They were simply good.  I had mezcal & ginger beer, and a bourbon based drink.|review|p3bzxY0j7eCBKVLlQaLCLQ|0|0|0

Granted, it was a lowkey Thursday night. Only a few patrons were sprinkled around the place; some even outside close to the fire.   I ordered a pitcher of Four Peaks' Island Ale. Why? Because as they said in Boston, it's cheapah! Besides, I had never had it before; it's quite good! Our server was kind enough to let me sample the Kona Lager and the Ale before I ordered. Did I finish the pitcher? Heck no. Can one person seriously drink all that? Wowza.   My bro enjoyed their Jack and Cokes.   And the music was cool. A very interesting mix. At one point, my bro requested ""Pepper"" by the BHS. They played it! That made my brother's night, and, like I said earlier, seeing my bro happy is what it's all about.   I ordered their little kabob app - one shrimp, one chicken, one beef. It was merely okay. I wouldn't order it again. Frankly, I wasn't impressed with their menu. I probably wouldn't suggest eating here, but if you want to stop in for a drink or to try the rare Four Peaks' brew, then it's a great spot. I like the outside area (minus the smoking) and enjoyed the decor of the inside.   Oh, and the servers look like they're actually comfortable at work - comfy shoes, track suits. They're also very nice, unlike other Scottsdale establishments.   Like John V said, this place is a cool spot to wind down... or, if you're looking to get out for a little bit, go on a lowkey night. You'll likely have the place to yourself.  Again, 5 stars for makin' my lil brother happy."|review|APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA|3|1|3

GMTEPYvrSCTWwEypmuSZUQ|2007-12-30|KDGsFRSymTxhFQ7OxXZxag|4|Comparable to Chipotle... better chicken and better pork, but the beef isn't as good. They actually make the tortillas from scratch right in front of you which is cool. I'm talking balls of dough flattened and then cooked. The chips are fresh too, but a little bland and boring - along with their salsa. I tried the 'hot' and it just tasted like a bean and butter sauce with no spice in it at all. Kinda gross truth be told...  If Chipotle was Port of Subs, then this place would be Quiznos - I guess that's a fancy way of saying that after they assembled my burrito, they toasted it. It was pretty nice. I ate every bite, so I guess it was good eh? They take the Chipotle thing one step further and you can garnish your aluminum take-out tray (yeah, even if you dine-in you're eating in take away containers - not so classy for a nice dinner, but fine for lunch) with beans or a salad or whatever you like.  This whole concept is pretty interesting - let's take a Mexican restaurant and cut out the waiters. It makes sense actually in quite a few ways (that I won't go into). People certainly don't seem to mind the cafeteria style dining since these places are always packed.   It's not going to be my favorite restaurant any time soon, and honestly if I'm driving this far for Mexican food I'm eating at Matta's. Still, it's very tasty... close second to Chipotle for this type of quickie sit-down meal.  On a side note - the strip mall it's in looks like it belongs in Dubai or something...|review|Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg|0|1|2

Their prices are higher than big box chains but what I like about REI is the fact that their staff is extremely knowledgeable. I'm willing to pay a little extra to know I'm getting the right product and service to go along with it.  When I backpacked through Thailand last year, there was no other place I'd think of going besides REI for my backpack and gear. One of the staff members guided my fiancee and I through the process of choosing a backpack and fitting us. Had I chosen to go to another store, I know for a fact the staff wouldn't have a clue as to how to fit me properly or been able to teach me how to adjust the complex straps so it would sit properly on the body.   Their return policy is 100% no questions asked, at any time, and I enjoy their co-op program you can sign up for. Basically you pay a one-time nominal fee and each time you purchase items, a certain percentage comes back to you at the end of the year in the form of a dividends check. Sounds good to me!   Since you have to fill out personal information to join this program, I inquired if they sold my information to any 3rd parties and the insisted they do not. Well, this is the reason they don't get 5 stars. To be quite honest I was peeved because a month after signing up, I received the first of about 4 different outdoor catalogues all addressed to me. I had never purchased from any of these retailers so I was puzzled as to why I was receiving them.   After calling the various 800 numbers on the back of each catalog to get myself off their lists, I asked them how I got on their lists. Each company informed me they got my information from REI. BOOOO!  My fiancee called their corporate office to complain but they gave a basically B.S. response that tiptoed around the fact that they DO in fact sell your personal information to 3rd parties. Had I known that I would have given an incorrect mailing address.  I do still continue to shop here though and recommend it to anyone wanting great service.|review|FHJUj7EHB9nB2czVOzQX3Q|4|3|4

With the already horrendous service, we figured service would be faster if we ordered items we could cook on the table top. When we the food arrived, we received only two sets of dishes and silverware for 4 people.

I've never found myself frequenting sports bars until I moved to Phoenix. When I moved here, I found that meeting up with new and old friends at sports bars can actually be fun. The key is finding the right sports bars, and Brad's Place fits that bill.  So what, to me, is the ""right"" kind of sports bar? A place where you can go and enjoy some drinks while watching an athletic competition. There are enough tv's to satisfy most, if not all of the patrons, and the service is friendly. Hopefully there's food, Good food is a bonus.   If I can get all of that without having to deal with the following then I'm a happy camper:  1. Rowdy/Drunk college kids  2. Rowdy/Drunk older dude (possibly shirtless with a painted face) who thinks he's a college kid or  3. Rowdy/Drunk, defensive D-bags who act as though the end result of a sports competition determines whether or not their steroid dealer is going to stop taking their call and Ed Hardy/TapOut/Affliction will continue to produce merch.  Yeah, so basically what I'm saying is that I'm not looking for trouble with anyone, a fight or jail time to result from a trip to a sports bar.  Like I said, on my visit, Brad's Place was the good kind. We sat near the bar and for the most part had a variety of football games to watch on the span of tv's. They had happy hour Sunday morning as well. Can't beat that!   It's a decent sized place with a patio out front if you feel like sitting outside. On my visit, it wasn't crowded at all. That was great.   I ordered the breaded pork loin sandwich for lunch and it was surprisingly very good. It was cooked perfectly so that it was still tender. The breading was crispy, but not over cooked or greasy. Same with the accompanying fries. I would absolutely order it again.   If you're looking for the ""good"" kind of sports bar, Brads Place is the place for you. If you're a person that falls into one of the ""bad"" sports bar categories I mentioned above... Please stay away from here... and get help."|review|7e1XAK4j95x-ibEy4qFKYg|1|2|3

Yhfp_vgnh_GirZGeVhj7Gg|2011-12-08|3ldco_7z7pNudRflIkJeXw|4|I am surprised at the reviews this theater is getting...I feel they should be much higher.  Since SMG opened on November 11th I have been there three times and have not had a single complaint.    I went to see Breaking Dawn on opening weekend and it was not over-crowded we basically walked in and got premium seating (the nice leather chairs) I do have to admit I would not be happy sitting in the rolling desk chairs I'm not sure whose idea that was but it was a bad one, but I have not had to sit in the desk chairs yet.  Once seated you can take a look at your menu and press the call button to order, a server runs right over and you place your order (I would suggest waiting a little to place your order the food comes out quick so if you arrive early you may be done eating before the movie starts) the prices are a little high but considering the convenience and the cost of movie theater food elsewhere it's not bad. Prices average from $8 to $12 for food items, $3 for soda, last time I went we got a bottle of wine it was right around $25 alcohol is in the $5 to $9 range per drink.  The picture and sound quality are great, no problems.  Overall I think this is the best movie theater in Scottsdale, it is clean and the ticket/food prices are very reasonable. I like iPic but you end up spending almost $40 just on tickets for two people, that's crazy. At SMG you get all of the same amenities for half the price.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star review is because there is always room for improvement, i.e. desk chairs?...|review|erZfP-EjGll3h7xG_6LyrA|0|0|0

Some of the best places are hidden gems, and this would be one of them.   The burger was cooked to order, the regular fries were perfect, the Sloppy Joe was our ""wildcard"" order and it was surprisingly delicious - add to that the french toast fries and it was like having a dessert with our lunch.

They were out of salmon and clam strips because, the waitress said, they were remodeling and were not stocking their inventory.  We ordered ribs and catfish meals.  The ribs were tough and the catfish was undercooked, tasted bad, and the portion was tiny.  The coleslaw was good as were the veggies.  The waitress forgot to apply my voucher and was not someone I would ever hire if I were to open a restaurant.  The only redeeming quality was that she informed the manager that were weren't happy and he did offer to get a new plate of fish.  Just before we paid, the waitress wrote on the chalkboard that they were unable to accept credit cards.  This place is off my list for good.  Red lobster is 5-star in comparison.|review|yFV1sitGtrLCBRUY0VP5tw|0|0|1

I have been shopping UO since I lived in Vermont back in junior high school in the 90s. They are getting the rap of ""wanna be a hipster, here's your uniform"", which is sort of unfair because much of their stuff is very basic, just with an edge.

If you want privacy, reserve the whole room.    Of course we had to start with some donuts, and I tried my hardest to resist them for as long as possible.

The spiciness is just right and there is a good compliment of green and red chile, and good variety of options.  The real issue I have with this restaurant is the service.  I keep going back periodically (not often) as I'm drawn by the food, along with convenience and reasonable prices - however, every single time the service is poor at best.  The servers are pleasant when standing at the table, but once they are gone - they're gone! - no place to be found!  You can get parched of thirst, have a mighty hungering for another chip, or be waiting on your bill - they just disappear - and this has happened every single time I've been there!  This is really probably more of a management and training issue - as it really seems to be the culture of the establishment.|review|na7c6gMDyReSKu5Yz2BM3g|0|0|1

Whereas I can't say low key-ness was had the entire evening, Dos was exactly what I had in mind.  The friendly bouncers informed us of the 50 cent night special every Thursday.  Pay $5 at the door, get 50 cent corona and wells until midnight.  SOLD!  Coming from NOLA where the drinks are insanely strong, I get a bit sad when I see the one shot pour perfectly calculated in my Scottsdale drinks.  Not the case at Dos.  I don't know why, but the awesome bartender upstairs was pouring heavy, and I liked it.  Speaking of, there IS an upstairs filled with a large patio, bar seating, pool table, air hockey and nooks to fit all your friends!  The upstairs and the heavy pouring bartender definitely turned my ""just ok"" feeling about Dos to ""let's go to Dos!""  The food is average Mexican bar food but will definitely save you from the morning after blues.  The weekends can get a little intense and there is usually a band playing.

Tangible is one of the few tanning salons I've used that isn't an overall annoying experience.  In fact, I actually enjoy going a few days a week.  I've had a monthly unlimited tanning membership here for over a year now.  The space is very modern and clean, and if you didn't know better you might think you were walking into an art gallery (they do sell the art that's displayed on the walls).  Clayton, who works the front counter, is just about the nicest guy in the world and presents a great face to this business.  I am always greeted by name and he always seems willing to do whatever he can to help to help me pick out a lotion, understand upgrade pricing, or decide on a bed type and duration to use.  The beds themselves are modern, clean and seem to always have new bulbs installed.  Towels are always available, along with eye goggles that are free for use (I used to take this for granted until I tried a couple salons in L.A. that didn't offer them).  There are plenty of lotions to choose from, and if you buy some here you can keep it behind the counter for when you come in (another feature I used to take for granted until realizing this is not a common offering at salons).  Tangible also owns Tangible fitness next door, an equally gorgeous space that houses a fitness gym.  I haven't tried this gym yet, but plan to try it soon and return with my review.  My mantra is that there are so few businesses anymore that really excel at what they set out to do, and Tangible Tanning is one of them.|review|4ISG7_E0jmpjIZlBBtZnQQ|3|1|4
TdNIQQcfslKjkey4-yAlKg|2013-08-25|LDja4zDvJkhLyFkiptEr9w|4|This place has great yogurt. I enjoy the more gelato-like flavors such as Chocolate and Peanut Butter, Strawberry Shake, Caramel, and Oatmeal Cookie. Those really shine here. Sorbet-like mixes such as Pomegranate provide a nice and welcome contrast. Since I don't like tart flavors, I can't speak to those. Also, the yogurt is more dense here than at other places, giving it the consistency of gelato: less air whipped in = more goodness.  A staff member MUST assist you with trying different flavors; I am told this is for hygiene reasons. Since most yogurt places allow you to sample flavors yourself, the policy must be explained to newcomers. A friendly sign explaining this would be nice.  The toppings bar is diligently stocked with a wide variety of goodies, all the time. Are you tempted? Here are 2 things you need to know if you want to be a regular:   - Loyalty discount! Buy 8 cups of yogurt, and get a $3.00 discount. Tell them to set you up on the system, and give your last name every time you buy yogurt. Now, you will have to remind them EVERY time you buy yogurt, or you will not get it! Sadly, they will not ask. I learned that the hard way, and missed out on credit for 8+ cups of yogurt.   - Groupon! For $15, you get 5 $6 vouchers, giving you $30 worth of purchasing power here. You must use them in $6 increments, so plan accordingly.   Have fun!  Edit: I removed the $.35 Tuesday, as this promotion is no longer happening. bring it baaaack!!|review|H2AW09HIHCst5ffuvZMSig|1|1|1

I will admit to a decent variety, but none of it was worth driving all the way to Maricopa for. I suppose if you were here to stay or gamble then the variety might impress you.

I have enjoyed their happy hour specials, particularly the lump crab cake appetizer, at their old DC Ranch venue.   This occasion was to celebrate the 88th birthday of a dear friend, reservations made, reservations honored, easy seating and stellar service. They took special care with regard to our guest of honor's special needs, such as accommodating his walker.  Having enjoyed pleasant experiences in the past I was not at all surprised by the quality of the food and the service.  We kept the appetizers light, and tried the spicy pot stickers. These were filled with spicy shrimp and pork with a light soy broth; slightly spicy and a good starter. The three of us shared a bottle of Meiomi Pinot Noir; a blend of three different Pinot's that was slightly more robust than usual. All three of us were so please with the wine that we made notes for future purchases. If you want something slightly lighter than a Cabernet Sauvignon this may be a wine for you.  For entrées two of us enjoyed the Florida grouper sautéed crisp and adorned in a lemon, garlic and scallions sauce. Our friend had the Prime New York strip Au Poivre cooked medium rare. All three entrées were cooked and served to perfection. I will try the Prime New York strip Au Poivre on my next outing.  The side dishes were a delightful surprise. We had the large size servings of truffled macaroni and cheese (nice crispy crust), steamed asparagus, and roasted baby beets and candied walnuts. The beets were a real hit with all of us. I have never been a big fan of beets but this treatment made an impression.  As I said earlier this was a birthday celebration and Eddie V's very generously provided a complimentary dessert, a chocolate Godiva cake à la mode. How can you possibly go wrong with chocolate and ice cream, it scored majors points all around and was a beautiful cap to a lovely evening.  I'll definitely be back for another go and will again take advantage of the happy hour specials and the piano bar.|review|fJ2EgWf7sYqj39PYuEN4pA|0|0|1

We opted to sit at the sushi bar and ordered a yellowtail roll, tuna roll, garlic edamame, and beef & broccoli. The sushi rolls were good, but a little pricey at $7 per roll. The garlic edamame was very flavorful. However, the beef & broccoli was pretty disappointing. While the beef & broccoli were cooked perfectly, it was pretty much ruined by the sauce. The sauce was way too sweet, and the dish was drowning in it.   Cooked dishes don't seem to be their forte, and the sushi is little bit pricier and no better than a few other sushi places in Phoenix.

When I finally made it there, I was slightly surprised by what I found.  The ambiance is somewhat odd, and not in the ""odd but quirky and cool"" sense you get from other vegan restaurants.  It's got kind of a strip mall chic feel to it, and the fifties music playing in the background made me feel like I got dropped in some bizarro ""Back to the Future"" scene, but the food was great and the couple that owns the place was really friendly!  I went on a Tuesday evening and I was the only one there--the place was dead.  It gave me pause at first, but the appetizer I ordered (Fried Imperial Rolls) was excellent, although the portions were small.  The vegetarian dipping sauce (whatever that is) was especially good.  For my meal I ordered Golden Soy Chicken--and although it looked like the same rubbery soy chicken substitute you might buy at the grocery store, it actually tasted like chicken!  The scrumptious citrusy ginger flavor of the sauce really made the dish, though.  The veggies seemed a bit more for garnish than for actual consumption, but they were ok, too.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5?  You pay too much for the size portions you get.  I had an appetizer and an entree and I still left not quite full.  I'm thinking I'll have to try this place for lunch sometime, since I work only right down the road."|review|KqemYCgDh0GunkBnfjgVfA|2|1|2

jnzROxEjNkgeo5Ju3F8qzQ|2011-01-15|LT2iPV3LCGdK4cgZlAculA|4|"Who knew this little Disneyland-esque restaurant existed in Cave Creek! I've been told by my parents that I came here when I was little but for some reason, I experienced memory-loss, because I don't remember any prior visits. With that being said, I'm mad at my memory for forgetting a cute spot so easily!  I love anyplace with a little atmosphere. The food doesn't even have to be phenomenal if the atmosphere exceeds expectations. When I visit a restaurant, I want to leave reality and enjoy a meal in la-la land. El Encanto provides that.  At this little oasis in the desert, this quaint restaurant is situated amongst cowboy tourist trap central, but there's nothing cowboy about this place. El Encanto provides a fun Mexican meal atmosphere. As you walk in through the courtyard, you notice tables surrounding a large pond of several ducks and swans. Yes swans! As the waitress put it, ""it's great for the guests and especially children...but not so great for me who has to feed them!"" I'm still not sure of the origin for why the ducks are there but it definitely adds to a atmospheric experience! The restaurant has Mexican tile and decor and it provides a fun experience for families, couples on a date or friends!  The food was definitely above par. The margaritas were tasty! We went with a pitcher since we were going to order several and here's a little tip...the waitress said that three margaritas come in a pitcher, but it definitely came out to be more like 4 (maybe just under). So it's definitely worth ordering a pitcher when you compare the price of a pitcher versus the price of an individual glass.  Second up, the guacamole. Delicious! They put cheese on top and it adds a nice little zing to the creamy guac. For my entree, I went for the Pollo Fundido. Here's the thing. It was delicious. Incredibly delicious. However, it was way to fatty and creamy for my waistline. That being said, it was still deliciously and filling. I could barely eat half of it so it might be worth sharing.  I would definitely make the drive to Cave Creek to visit El Encanto again."|review|4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ|3|2|3

I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakery's croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. That's all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)  I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery.   They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants.

The small dining  room was crowded for a Friday, especially right before the Balloon festival. Are server Mary Lousie was attentive and explained in detail the specials and the menue items. We choose to do the fresh Salmon with sphagetti squash and the Beef Tenderloin. Since we told her we wanted to share she split the meal for us without any charge. We have a small salad. The wines by the glass were limited but good. We choose the La Crema. Driving and wine tasting in AZ is not a good idea. The meal came promptly and boy was the encrusted salmon to die for.  The beef tenderloin was soft and at medium perfect.  The portions are large at the average price per entry of $22-35. You might be asking for a doggy bag for your spoiled pup.  Since it was a date set up by her daughter one of the hostesses the server must have known. He he.,  When we told her no room for desert she insisted.  Next came out a cold plate with a special box filled with two homemade truffles compliments of the chef.  Wow what a treat. Also it was nice touch to have the frozen writing on the plate tell us to enjoy this every.   This place will certainly be a highly recommendation for the special event when I am looking to splurge a little. Bravo to the staff and Chef.|review|KBr7UXlfD-Qrq8dk4o2XMw|0|0|0

In the fall/halloween spirit, we decided to get two of their pumpkin tamales (frozen).  The next night for a nice dessert, we prepared them in the steamer.  I don't know what I was expected, but, wow, they sure were good.  Went back the next week, and decided to get something a little more savory (in addition to a couple more pumpkin ones).  We settled on two ground beef/cheese and two green chili chicken.  Again, we prepared them in the steamer from frozen.  And again, they were quite good, I cleaned my plate and part of my wife's as well.  Definitely will be getting more tamales from there, they are so good.  The only thing keeping them from a five star review is that in the two pack of ground beef tamales, there was one ground beef and one shredded meat (probably beef, but quite possibly pork).  Hopefully it was just a one time mistake, a lot of people (like me!) don't eat pork for one reason or another...|review|XpejQYZqVcYGX7fYuYHzSw|1|0|2
supigcPNO9IKo6olaTNV-g|2010-04-16|XjOYpFg9H_MwXHSgT9jmkA|3|I am torn as to how to rate 11:30.  I have had many, many a lovely morning/early afternoon here drinking their FABULOUS $2 bloody mary's and mimosa's.  Sitting on the patio drinking for practically free is NEVER a bad way to spend a Saturday morning.    HOWEVER, if you want to eat, there are a million other, better places to go.  Local Breeze, Hula, Switch, Carly's.  All have amazing Bloodies and Mimosas with great food to boot.  I went in with a group of friends for brunch one morning.  The place was empty like a Filibertos after a raid.  Still, we waited incredibly  long times for our drinks, the order, and finally, our food.  The drinks were fine, but offers for refills did not come at all.  When the food arrived, it was...um, well, inedible.   After waiting 30 minutes for it, we were looking forward to some yummy goodness.  We had, after all, ordered practically one of each of the brunch specials.    None of it was good.  The conversation with the server went like this:  SERVER:  So, how is everything?  GROUP:  Ummm.  (Silence)  SERVER:  I will take your silence as a good thing.  ME:  Don't.  SERVER:  Excuse me?  ME:  This is bad.  I am sorry, I don't usually complain, but this is, collectively, the worst breakfast I've ever been served.  SERVER:  Excuse me. (He leaves)  This is why the place is getting three stars and not none.  The manager came back just a few minutes later, chatted with us for a moment, apologized, and comped all five meals.  Completely comped them.  (This is not a good strategy for getting free stuff, incidentally.  The food really was awful.  Free awful food is still free, but more importantly, its still awful.)  Of course we left our server a huge tip, and got the hell outta dodge.    I will still say that the drinks are great, the Bloodies are some of the best around and who can beat $2, and the pancakes are good.  Reaaallllly good.   But the rest...mmm, not so much.|review|GVRWfB32i_zvIMJBfbvoBg|0|0|0

I am a huge book nerd and fall asleep with them on probably every night, leading to careless bending. Since they are antique, taking them to any old eyeglass place scares me. A woman examined my glasses a couple months ago and recommended this particular branch of the chain to me to whup into shape.  I swung by there when repeated drunken dance nights had made tall friends knock my glasses on to the dance floor too many times (this happens many many more times than I like to think about) and a nice dude tightend them up for me in less than five minutes, free of charge. He offered he could replace the old yellowed nose pieces for me pretty cheaply.  Today, after finally admitting my frames looked groady, were falling off my face, and I had scotch taped the old, dry and SHARP ear hooks to a very lame solution, I hiked it over to the AAER. They were able to start working on them on the spot and I told them I would just hang out since I was totally blind and couldn't go anywhere while they worked on them. Less than 45 minutes later, I was presented my frames looking more beautiful than when I first purchased them and they fit wonderfully. Both guys who have helped me there have been extremely nice and efficient and for my sparkling new frames I was charged a MEASLY nineteen BUCKS ($19 folks!) that included tax!  They also said they could weld and fix almost anything wrong with frames or lenses. Super professional and cheap!|review|mfvezpz6ohS0NQk3DZdvqQ|5|3|5

Unfortunately, I forgot that too often hipster is synonymous with pretentious.

The service was OK, not overly helpful as we already to look up several things on the menu since it made no sense to us non-foodies. And I understand that we get overserved in America and portions should normally be smaller, but for what we got versus what it cost, I felt slighted.  And it wasn't that tasty either.

KBG28p3lGX17hOPoHhq5PQ|2007-11-25|8J5F7tcGyiJf6oj2_7GbAA|4|"I have relatives out in Phoenix, so I always go out to Arizona for Thanksgiving. Arizona is not exactly a culinary Mecca, and I'm not a big fan of turkey dinners (don't crucify me for being un-American), so by the end of Thanksgiving, I'm usually desperate for a good meal. Usually, after a big heavy Thanksgiving meal, I'm so burnt out that I want something simple and clean, like Japanese food.   Unfortunately, in Arizona, a good Japanese meal is hard to find as most sushi restaurants are all about the dragon-uppercut-rolls and crispy-dynamite-ju-ju-mojo-and-the-kitchen-sink crap made by sake-bomb pounding ""sushi chefs"" who think Japanese cuisine must always include a squirt from a bottle of Sriracha hot sauce and a helping of mayonnaise.  So when my brother-in-law recommended Yasu, I was more than a bit skeptical, having gone to his other recommendations in the past. Fortunately, after dragging him to all the good Japanese restaurants in LA this summer, I think he's finally developed a good sense of what Japanese food is all about.  To put it simply, Yasu is probably the best Japanese restaurant in Arizona. I sat at the counter in front of the owner/chef, Yasu-san, and asked what the omakase course included. He explained that it includes a sampling of sashimi, yakimono (grilled items), and sushi. Couldn't have asked for anything better after an overdose of dry turkey.   We started with kumamoto oysters with a light ponzu sauce. The oysters were very fresh--I'm a huge oyster fan so I like my oysters simple, but I can see others liking the flavor combinations of the ponzu and the green onions with their oysters. Next came hamaguri shichirin-yaki (large clams grilled over hot coals). The big, juicy pieces of clam grilling in their own juice with a hint of soy sauce were simple yet divine. Fresh sashimi followed which included some nice pieces of chu-toro, sweet shrimp, and huge Boston scallops, all of which were devoured as soon as the plate was down. The scallops were really sweet and succulent. Yasu-san explained that he gets it shipped directly from the fisherman in Boston.  The charcoal grilled course started off with tomato and asparagus wrapped in bacon (pretty good), followed by what's got to be the best tsukune (chicken meat ball) I've ever had in the US. And I'm pretty picky when it comes to tsukune. The minced chicken meat is chunky and retains the great texture of chicken, and the yakitori sauce is nice and restrained, allowing the smoky flavors of the binchotan (Japanese hardwood charcoal) to come through. Yasu-san actually imports all of his charcoal from Japan as its low smoke and high heat is optimal for grilling. He then served beef tongue marinated in miso. This, along with the tsukune was the highlight of the night. When I saw the thick cuts of beef tongue, I envisioned 30 minutes of chewing as big pieces of tongue tend to be tough, but I was completely wrong. Tender, tasty, absolutely wonderful. When I complimented the chef on how good these were, he grinned and told me that it's tender because he only uses the back of the tongue--the tip tends to be really tough.  I was getting pretty full at this point, but out came seared scallops--the chef probably noticed how much I liked the scallops. I was pretty full, but god, were these scallops good! We really must have come on the right day.  At this point, I was stuffed, so Yasu-san prepared four pieces of sushi to finish the meal. Now, this was the only disappointment of the night. The sashimi and everything else were so good, I expected the sushi to be just as good. Unfortunately, the pieces of tuna and salmon weren't very flavorful, and the unagi was a bit on the dry side. The rice was a bit underseasoned as well. It was somewhat of a disappointing finish after otherwise and excellent meal, but it was okay since I was pretty much stuffed to the gills at that point.   Having so many different types of dishes, I can see why they decided to call it a Japanese bistro rather than a sushi restaurant. Although their sushi was not at the level of top sushi restaurants in Socal, I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who's in the Phoenix area looking for excellent Japanese food.  For the purists, they may be put off by some of their dishes, which do cater to the masses, such as their rolls and ""dynamite"". But I assure you that their non-Americanized dishes are solid."|review|mq4Y2uqM819juccWJBLLNw|6|2|5

The table that we were seated at had some type of dressing covering the table.  It wasn't some tiny inconspicuous dressing, I could have dipped my wing in the dressing with enough to go back for seconds.  Finally our server came over to take our order and I pointed out the condiments on the table and he apologized and took care of it in a timely manner. He took our order at 7:15P.M. and it was a very easy order, 18 boneless wings, another order of boneless wings, and French fries.  An acceptable ticket time on thirty wings and a side of fries shouldn't be any longer than fifteen minutes, if that.  It took until 8:00P.M. until after the team captain overheard us starting to complain about the length of time we have been waiting for our food.  She went to check on our order and at that time I realized that the server forgot to place our order.  I use to be a server all through college so I can read what's really going on.  After the Captain walked away to check on our food the server came by to check on our drinks which is a sign from management to go see if he could do anything for us while they expedite our forgotten order.  After waiting over fifty minutes for wings my wife lost her appetite, her daughter had homework to do for school, and I had other business to attend to as well.  We finally had enough and just walked out frustrated, hungry, and unsatisfied.  This isn't the first time that this happened at this location.  About six months ago I had the exact same experience, maybe not as bad as this visit but it was terrible.  I said I would never return again to this location but the general manager called me and tried to make it right.  It worked for my other times I visited but this visit was the icing on the cake.  I'm done with this Buffalo Wild Wings I will never give my business to you again.|review|f6WnqbRp3aA_2lv4C86fDw|1|1|1

I have to say, the atmosphere of this place needs help. All the blue was a little too much.   That being said, the burgers we ordered were very good. I had the BYOB with Bison, onion bun, sharp cheddar, red onions, jalapenos (fresh), dill pickles, herb mayo, and mustard. The only complaint I have is that the bun was way too big for me to get a bite of the entire burger, but I was willing to let that slide. I got the sweet potato fries, which were good.   My husband ordered the slider sampler, with the Blu burger, California burger, and BBQ burger. All were very good. Also got the zucchini fries, which were very good as well.  We are ranch snobs, and I think their ranch here was lacking, but that is just a personal taste.  All-in-all, very good burger. We will be back for sure.|review|QUMoXi8VwfCWF-u6Up5MQQ|0|0|3
yRga-WpyfZRz8Es4OpyMhA|2010-07-20|IlpWY3ZuyHWP8hma6EzURQ|1|I wanted to update my initial review to let everyone know that things have gotten even WORSE at LA Fitness.  As mentioned previously, there are only 4 regular stairclimbers at this gym which are supposed to accommodate the thousands of unappreciated members.  Only TWO of these stairclimbers now work (one of which has been broken since the Spring).  Please see the photo above.  Instead of replacing equipment that continues to break month after month, LA Fitness will just slap an out of order sign on it and call it a day.  Suffice it to say that they have not purchased a single piece of new cardio equipment in years because it would actually cost money.  Speaking of investing in the facility, the carpets are so full of crusty sweat and mildew that the stench permeating from the building is starting to get nauseating.  The absence of towels and the lack of a proper amount of sanitizer and paper goods throughout the gym makes this situation worse by the day.  Anyone know if 24 Hour Fitness is having a membership promo these days?  I would RUN off the treadmills at LA Fitness now to find out.|review|7oaogEbu1xBlGZaDeMl6Gw|2|1|4

However, he wasn't pushy about the specials.  As suggested, the hummus with meat and pine is hummus with beef and pine nuts and was a great appetizer.  We tried both the lentil and the tomato soup. The lentil was good, but the tomato was creamy, had basil and was my favorite of the two. We also tried the falafel as well as the gyros plate. Both were very good and very reasonably priced.

We couldn't finish dessert, which is saying something (and by ""something"" I mean I went into a cheese coma post-meal).Go with a larger party to taste more dishes without accidentally eating to the point of no return after only ordering a few.  We started with the cannellini bean vasi. The spread was creamy, smoky, and studded with purple onion. A stack of really crunchy toasts drizzled with olive oil were served on the side. The oil seemed like overkill, but it didn't subtract from the dish, so all is forgiven. Next up was the most significant thing that happened to my tastebuds/me in general all week.   Enter truffle egg toast. Soft yolk, fontina, truffle, asparagus. This plate was definitely smaller than the rest, but it was exceptionally rich and complex. I'm ordering this for myself and stabbing anyone who tries to ""share"" with my fork next time. We went for the homemade ricotta gnocchi afterwards, which was a great mix - eggplant, tomato, garlic, and fresh, melty mozzarella. The ricotta gave the dumplings a slightly fluffier texture, but it wasn't a huge deviation from the standard. Overall, the mozzarella definitely made the dish.  Last but most, dessert. First up, the goat cheesecake was crustless, topped with caramel and almond brittle. It had a very light texture and musky, rich flavor which needed the sweet contrast of the caramel and brittle. The almond brittle added a lot, and in the future, I'd ask for extra. The Purple Pig was two slices of super crunchy, grilled bread with a dollop of Nutella, homemade marshmallow fluff, and bananas in the center. Simple, delicious, and passable as lunch? Maybe? It's worth a shot.  Everyone was attentive and happy to answer questions, but they wore basketball shorts, were covered in tats and piercings, and just were not givin' a sh*t about their presentation. At an upscale restaurant, it was a refreshing twist that made Davanti feel far from uptight. 'Twas unconventional but thoroughly enjoyable, much like everything else. I'll definitely be back in the market for some of that again soon."|review|BjwXX-sChcjx2E55B_7rXg|1|1|4

Our waitress was phenomenal (i wish I could recall her name as she truly deserved 5 stars)...,fathers day 7pm reservation....middle Teppanyaki table.  Our chef, ""tom cruise"", was equally phenomenal and provided the best Teppanyaki dinner show I've seen (blows away Benihana); a true entertainer.  Price wasn't bad and they had both a kids menu for Teppanyaki and a happy hour menu for a slightly smaller portion, which reduced the impact on your wallet.  The wine pour was generous.  My only criticism and reason for 4 stars was the vegetable portion was skimpy and didn't include bean sprouts.  If they could upsize the vegetable portion on their Teppanyaki,  this would be a 5 star review."|review|uiC-DzqIKeQuUs3B0eELTw|0|0|1

It is dirty and slightly unnerving when you order the first time but in my opinion, it is well worth it. Some people violently disagree and aren't willing to chance getting the runs to eat here, but for me that is a chance I will willingly take.   My order is essentially the same every time: a massive carne asada burrito with a large horchata. So, the moral of the story is that Filibertos isn't for everyone, but for those who aren't afraid of possibly eating cat, it is a winner. It is also very inexpensive so it is popular with the college crowd. Try it.|review|tNpfNLjxS34wmsroFemoNg|0|3|2

The folks who work here in my experience so far are genuinely nice and take their work seriously. Early morning crew better? The bad. The service can be really slow at times. The barristas do take their work seriously, but sometimes the supurfluous chatter causes back-ups. I really want to like the coffee here, but it just tastes, well, bad. I'm not some kind of java expert but I know when my palate is unhappy. I've tried many different brews and types trying to find a happy compromise, but to no avail. In addition the prices are a bit on the high end in my opinion. Depending on your choice of coffees, the ""large"" ends up coming in a medium cup. Weird.

Far better pricing and speed than down the street at La Familia which is basically now a loud obnoxious bar, with Mexican food on the side sadly.  Federico's has a lot of daily specials. Check their website for coupons, specials, menus, prices.  Monday AND Tuesday is 99 Cent Tacos (reg. $2.09+) and $1.99 burritos (reg. $3).    they have a nice little salsa bar, but also have red radishes sliced  up, jalepenos, onions/jalepenos julienned.  And they don't ration your salsa or charge extra for to go salsa like La Familia does.  I often find that going inside is quicker than the drive through.  Not sure why. I think everything is made to order, so if someone gets something unusual in the drive thru, it holds up the line.  I wish this was close to my work, I'd go there a lot more.

It was easy to tell the locals from the tourists as a dust storm blew in. The place practically cleared out with cameras clicking and videos rolling to capture this common local event.

I feel as though I'm shorting them with 4, but that I'm being too generous to award a solid 5.  I arrived with my date to find we were the only patrons to arrive for dinner, and it was 6:30! A bit surprised to find it so barren, we were seated by an older man, very talkative and bursting with personality. He took care of the basics, then proceeded to chat with us about this and that. I could tell he was attempting to make us feel welcome...keep in mind this large, banquet-style room was empty, the only soul in it perched at the bar, solo. My girlfriend went with his suggestion of a Greek red wine (I can't recall the name, however she loved it). I ordered a great-tasting Greek lager, Marathon IIRC.  After our drinks arrived, presented to us by the hilariously entertaining host, we browsed over the ample menu to find our entree. As soon as he described the 'family secret' recipe to me, Lamb Capama, I was sold. He had this matter-of-fact attitude when describing it as if to say ""This is the dish you want, sir"", so I ordered it with the quickness. I'm so happy he made this suggestion. This lamb was so juicy, so tender, and so flavorful! It's almost so good it's bad, as I know the next time I return to Bacchanal I'll probably get the same thing and not try the others! My girlfriend went with a feta-stuffed chicken dish of sorts, I don't recall the name, however she was praising it after almost every bite.  Our entrees were delivered by a younger man with black, spiky hair. He was, I'm going out on a limb here, unmistakably Grecian. I certainly don't mean this in a bad way, as he was a fantastic waiter, almost as enjoyable as the host who entertained us prior. I mention this because every person who waited on us during our visit was memorable at LEAST.  About halfway through our dinner, a group of 12-18 came in and sat in the middle of the room, nearest the 'stage' area. There were a few more couples who came in, and were seated, scattered throughout the front-stage area. My girlfriend & I were enjoying a quiet, romantic dinner when all this ruckus came through the front door, but we didn't mind much. More waitstaff surrounded the tables, no more noticeable ambient noise as the group's chatter dominated the acoustics, and a belly-dancer entered stage right....what a change. the must've been waiting for the evening rush or something because this happened almost on queue. The staff tried to get everyone involved with dancing and singing and whatnot. This was okay with me, but on that particular night I was not into it.  Anyways, the food was fan-damn-tastic, and worth the price. Drinks were more than satisfactory. The waitstaff was superb; with their service & suggestions. It was more than 2 months ago since this experience and I'm VERY surprised I've not been back for a follow-up visit.  GREAT joint."|review|cZxY3BVSjkUmKcoAVJH9tA|2|0|2

The owner really did a wonderful job transforming this place - I went to high school right down the street and remember not stopping into the place it was previously because it made me feel so claustrophobic. This is a perfect example of making the best use of a small space. It's beautiful, modern, and surprisingly bigger than expected inside.  My boyfriend and I are regulars here - and even though we've moved out of the area we still make the drive up as frequently as the price of gasoline will allow us. Last time I stopped in, the barista greeted me like I was his sister who just came back from a year abroad - never have I felt so welcomed to a place. He showered me with compliments and expressed genuine happiness and gratitude for stopping in knowing that I no longer live near by.  In addition to great staff, the food/drinks are DELICIOUS. I'll just list off my favorites:  - open face grilled cheese (hot, open face caprese sandwich) - 3 diff types of bruschetta: brie + apple + honey                                                  tomato + basil + balsamic glaze                                                  gorgonzola + banana peppers + sun dried tomato - nutella cheesecake for dessert (and I don't even like cheesecake) - Shea Breeze (cocktail) - Iced chai w/ almond milk (their chai is very unique - so good)  Bonuses: Wednesdays are $20 for a bottle of wine + bruschetta, and sometimes they do ""Free Nutella Fridays"" where you can add Nutella to any drink for free. Also, if you ""like"" them on Facebook they post their daily dinner menu - they have a solid menu but they feature a new dinner entree every day. Including a veggie option as well. If you like to be involved with places and keep track of specials I'd highly recommend that!  32 Shea is BY FAR my favorite restaurant/coffee shop in North Phoenix.

Line gets long here around lunch but service is quick so it goes by really fast. I love the burrito bowl options because it tricks my body into taking in salad as a meal (although I wouldn't really compare it to a salad haha).|review|iKDDbFu1lyA8-CVlGLFHcw|0|0|0

First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat.   We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.  Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)|review|uZetl9T0NcROGOyFfughhg|1|0|2

We are at one of the BJ's restaurants weekly and we found Sarah to be the best waitress in our 4 year experience. Friendly, always keeping the drinks flowing, asked if we wanted our tea''s to go, understood their rewards program.  And as always the food was great. Always a great place you can count on for great food and always consistent.|review|T--G8645Ew-iC8LQha1j3w|0|0|0

About a month ago I decided to give them another chance, and tried the Kung Pao Chicken, and since then I have literally been back 6-7 times. For the price it's the best Kung Pao I have ever had. The vegetables are fresh, the sauce is unique and there's plenty of peanuts, an ingredient that imo makes or breaks a good Kung Pao. Their lunch and dinner combos come with fried rice something I don't care for but their fired rice isn't bad at all.|review|F9HbpJhKDPRz8qGLqPX-8Q|0|0|0

Currently in the process of renovating - new carpet, new furniture, and so on.  Hence I found the place did not smell very good at all.  Personally I don't like to inhale new carpet fumes all day.  It was not as bad as it could have been - with the window open and fan blowing it was tolerable, but truly the rooms need to be aired out before being suitable for residents.   Bathrooms could use renovation - the tub was chipped in many places and the shower head looked ancient.  Maybe they'll be next...  There was nothing particularly wrong with the Hawthorn, it was adequate for my needs, but there were lots of little ways they could improve:  Softer tissues, new shower head, new tub, softer sheets, nicer curtains.  At this price though, it was really nothing to complain about.|review|W6aKYsNtTYNkPsAILQ8Q9A|1|0|1

Lol. It might not be very ladylike but hey, it's sincere! So here it is a ""burp"" and a satisfied smile for Jasmine Tokyo!"|review|ru8p3RTlk8f9LB_3zLXURQ|1|2|1
